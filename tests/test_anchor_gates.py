"""The two anchor gates that were added after the other three stayed green.

`scripts/anchors.py --check` asserted that every index has an anchor, that its
`reference_level` still matches `indices.py`, and that the declared gap
recomputes from the file's own rows. All three were true, and all three stayed
true, while ACR-INF lost five of its ten basket rows — every Anthropic, Google
and Mistral model in it. Measured 2026-10-07: 5 priced of 10 requested, down
from 6, with no signal in any gate, log or page.

They stayed true because each is a property of the rows that REMAIN. A median
over five rows recomputes exactly as well as a median over ten.

WHY THAT IS NOT COSMETIC. `par.market_basket` returns a `Basket` whose `usable`
property requires both quotes and an empty status, and `app.py`'s `/par` route
reads it like this:

    is_first_party(payee) or not basket.usable  ->  price against the FLEET

So a basket that empties or ages out does not produce a missing answer. It
produces a confident wrong one: a stranger's invoice benchmarked against our own
sellers, on a scale `anchors/GAP.md` puts 20x to 1250x off market, from the one
endpoint whose entire claim is that it compares you to somebody else.

THESE TESTS EXIST BECAUSE A GATE NOBODY HAS SEEN FAIL HAS NOT BEEN TESTED. The
coverage ratchet and the age limit are both one comparison each, and a
mis-typed operator or a threshold read from the wrong field would leave them
permanently green — which is indistinguishable from the state they were added
to end. So each one is driven to failure here, on a copy, and the committed
baskets are never touched.
