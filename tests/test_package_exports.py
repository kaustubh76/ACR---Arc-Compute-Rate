"""Every name a package promises in `__all__` must actually resolve.

This exists because it did not. Removing the World integration deleted
`acr_oracle_client/humanid.py`, and six names it had provided stayed behind in
`acr_oracle_client.__all__`: `RATING_WINDOW_S`, `cluster_id`, `salt_commitment`,
`window_of`, `current_window` and `as_bytes32`. The package imported fine, every
`from acr_oracle_client import X` for a surviving name worked, the whole suite
was green, and `make ci` exited 0 — because **nothing in this repo does
`from <package> import *`**, which is the only operation that reads `__all__`.

So `__all__` was a contract with no counterparty. The failure it produced,
`AttributeError: module 'acr_oracle_client' has no attribute 'RATING_WINDOW_S'`,
would have landed on the first outside caller to write the one line we never
write ourselves.

The check is deliberately over ALL packages rather than the one that broke. A
test named after a single incident catches that incident again; this catches the
next deletion in any of the six. It is also why the assertion reports every
missing name at once instead of failing on the first — a half-finished removal
usually orphans a cluster of names, and fixing them one CI run at a time is how
a five-minute edit becomes an afternoon.
