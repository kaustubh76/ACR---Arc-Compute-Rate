"""A bill covers a PERIOD, and the second run has to be able to pay.

An obligation had no window. `_obligations` filtered on `payer` and nothing
else, and `obligation_key` had no time component — so `(seller, resource)` named
a bill for all of history, and once it was paid that pair sat in `settled_refs`
forever. Every later settlement from the same seller for the same service summed
into an id that was already there and was refused as a duplicate.

Nobody could see it, for two reasons that are both worth remembering. A human
runs this once, so there was never a second run. And the test suite asserted the
half that worked — `test_operator_duplicates.py` pins "a retried bill is refused
once it has really been paid" and "an unpaid history refuses nothing", both
correct — and never asked what happens to consumption that is genuinely new.

On a schedule it is fatal and silent: the first tick pays, every tick after it
refuses everything, and the only symptom is a number that stops going up.

The two halves have to hold at once, which is why they are tested together: new
consumption must be PAID, and a retry inside one window must still be REFUSED.
Either alone is easy and useless.
