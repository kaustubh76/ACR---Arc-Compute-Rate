# ACR seller API — x402-gated FastAPI service (services/index_api).
# Build:  docker build -t acr-api .
# Run:    docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env acr-api
# All runtime config is ACR_* env vars (see .env.example); with none set the
# service comes up credential-free on the dev gate + simulator tape.
