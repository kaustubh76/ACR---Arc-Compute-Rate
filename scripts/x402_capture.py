"""Fold the seller's real x402 settlements into the durable archive.

A live payment lands in the seller's runtime receipt log — which sits on a
filesystem the production plan does not persist. So a real settlement is
visible until the next restart and then gone, and `/revenue` drops back to
zero over a gate that has genuinely been paid. That is the state this project
was in for a week.

The archive at `ACR_RECEIPT_ARCHIVE_PATH` is committed AND inside the image, so
it survives every restart. It lives under `services/` rather than `data/`
because that directory is excluded from both git and the Docker build — a file
there would never reach production, which is the trap this landed in first
time round.

This reads the seller's own ledger — the authoritative record, since the seller
is the side that ran verify and settle against Circle — and merges anything new
into that file.

Run it right after a live buy, then commit the file:

    uv run python scripts/x402_capture.py                  # == make x402-capture
    ACR_API_URL=https://… uv run python scripts/x402_capture.py
    X402_CAPTURE_DRY_RUN=1 …                               # show, write nothing

Exit codes: 0 = archive is up to date (with or without new rows); 1 = the
seller could not be read, or returned something that is not a ledger.
