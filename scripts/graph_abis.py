"""Extract the subgraph's ABIs from Foundry's own build artifacts.

The Terminal hand-inlines its ABIs (`apps/terminal/lib/onchain.ts`), and they
have drifted from the contracts before. The subgraph does not get to make that
mistake: `graph/abis/*.json` is generated from `contracts/out/`, so a contract
change that is not reflected in the mappings fails at `graph codegen` instead of
at query time.

    uv run python scripts/graph_abis.py      # or: make graph-abis

Needs `forge build` to have run (`make build-contracts`).
