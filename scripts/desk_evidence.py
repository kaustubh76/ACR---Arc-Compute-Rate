"""Public Desk evidence — prove the user-controlled run actually hit the chain.

The E2E driver (``scripts/desk_e2e.mjs``) asserts on what the UI says. This
asserts on what Arc says, from two independent directions:

  * **Circle's ledger** — every transaction the user's own wallet submitted,
    with its state, tx hash and network fee. The fee is the honest answer to
    "is Gas Station sponsoring this SCA?", which the UI merely claims.
  * **The chain itself** — ``CollateralPosted`` / ``Traded`` logs filtered to
    that wallet, plus a live ``positionOf`` read. A position that reads back
    non-zero is the thing no amount of UI polish can fake.

Reads ``data/desk_e2e_last.json`` for the wallet the run created (or takes
``--address``), and needs ``--user`` to pull the Circle side (a fresh user token
is minted server-side; no PIN involved — these are reads).
