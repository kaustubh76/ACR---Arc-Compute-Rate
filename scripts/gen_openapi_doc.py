"""Render docs/acr-openapi.md from the live OpenAPI schema — which is what that
file has claimed to be since it was written, and never was.

THE FILE WAS A HAND-EDITED DOC WEARING A GENERATED ONE'S LABEL. docs/README.md says
"rendered from the live OpenAPI 3.1 schema"; there was no script, no Makefile
target, and the one commit that touched it added a single line by hand. It listed
24 routes when the service had 43 — every route added since the hedger, including
the whole agent gate, was simply absent from "the endpoint reference". The house
rule at Makefile `deck:` names this exact shape: a generated file with an
unrecorded recipe is a hand-edited file that nobody admits to.

Source of truth is `app.openapi()` — the same object `tests/test_endpoint_register_
parity.py` reads — so this cannot disagree with the service. The paid/free split
comes from GATED_ENDPOINTS, the list `/x402/info` serves, not from a second copy —
which is also why `/compute/{label}` had to join that list: a per-seller paid route
the service's own descriptor called free. `--check` makes staleness a CI failure like `golden-check` and `anchors-check`.

#: Where a reader should actually send a request, and what each host serves.
#:
#: THIS WAS ONE HARDCODED HOST AND IT WAS THE WRONG ONE. `API` read
#: `https://acr-api-mainnet.onrender.com` while the route list below was
#: rendered from the LOCAL checkout — so this document named a host, listed
#: fifty routes, and that host answered **404** for six of them (`/par` and all
#: five `/operator/*`). Measured 2026-10-12 with `make verify-drift`: 44 served
#: of 50 built. `--check` compares this file to the repo, so the gap was
#: invisible to the gate by construction; it took asking the hosts.
#:
#: TESTNET IS LISTED FIRST, deliberately. It serves the whole surface, it has a
#: faucet, and nobody's real money is involved in a stranger's first call. The
#: mainnet pair is below it, with the incomplete one named as incomplete rather
#: than as the canonical address.
#:
#: `tests/test_doc_hosts.py` asserts that no reader-facing document names a host
#: alongside a route that host does not serve.
