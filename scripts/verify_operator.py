"""Prove the deployed operator surfaces — one exit code.

    VERIFY_TERMINAL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 uv run python scripts/verify_operator.py

`verify_live.py` proves the seller and `verify_loop.py` proves the /loop page's
instruments. This proves the three surfaces a Tameion reviewer will open: the
business list, one business's Spend Statement, and its beancount ledger.

IT CHECKS THE HONESTY PROPERTIES, not just the status codes, because a 200 on a
page that quietly says the wrong thing is the failure that matters here:

  * the statement never carries `overpaid_usdc` — the index's dollar figure,
    which `anchors/GAP.md` puts 20x to 1250x off market and which would read as
    money on an owner's page;
  * the traction payload reports mainnet and testnet apart, with no field
    adding them;
  * `moved_usdc` and `priced_usdc` are both present, because collapsing them
    into one number is the most tempting lie on a traction page;
  * every served ledger balances — each transaction's postings sum to zero;
  * an unconsented business is never named, and an unknown one 404s rather
    than returning an empty statement that reads as "has spent nothing".

Nothing here spends and nothing here needs a key: every surface it touches is a
free read, which is the point of them.
