"""Re-sign v1's recent prints into ACROracleV2 — BEFORE the first live v2 post.

`postPrint` enforces strictly monotone economic timestamps. Once v2 takes one
live print, no earlier one can ever be inserted — so a v2 that starts empty
stays empty for its whole history, the subgraph's arrival ring has nothing in
it, and every settlement in the demo window comes back `benchmarked: false`.
This is the one step in the migration whose ORDER is not recoverable.

    ACR_ORACLE_V2_ADDRESS=0x… uv run python scripts/backfill_oracle_v2.py --dry-run
    ACR_ORACLE_V2_ADDRESS=0x… uv run python scripts/backfill_oracle_v2.py

Reads v1's history on chain (`historyLength`/`historyAt`) rather than over logs:
Arc caps `eth_getLogs` at ~15k blocks, so paging a year of prints would be dozens
of round trips against a throttled RPC.

Every backfilled print is stamped with a DISTINGUISHED policy hash — these were
re-signed now, not produced by the estimator then, and a tape that blurred the
two would invite exactly the re-derivation it exists to support. The window is
reconstructed as the nominal hour ending at each print's own timestamp, matching
what the live poster publishes.

Exit codes: 0 = backfilled (or a dry run produced a plan); 1 = nothing could be.
