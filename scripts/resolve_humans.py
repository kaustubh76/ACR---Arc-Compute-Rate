"""Record which wallets act for which verified human, so the tape can count them.

The manipulation bound ACR publishes is denominated in wallets, and a wallet
costs a funding transfer. Denominating it in humans is the whole point of Module
W, and it needs one fact the chain does not otherwise have: which payer wallets
belong to one person. This writes that fact — as a WINDOW-ROTATED CLUSTER ID,
never a World ID nullifier. See `contracts/src/HumanIdMirror.sol` for why.

    ACR_HUMANID_MIRROR_ADDRESS=0x… uv run python scripts/resolve_humans.py --dry-run
    ACR_HUMANID_MIRROR_ADDRESS=0x… uv run python scripts/resolve_humans.py --commit

RUN THIS BEFORE GENERATING TAPE. `Settlement.human` is stamped at finalize and
the entity is immutable, so a payer that settles before it is resolved is counted
non-human forever and its volume never reaches `humanVolume`. The subgraph flags
it (`Payer.resolvedLate`) but cannot repair it.

Reads the AgentBook — the fixture roster until World Sandbox access exists, and
every fixture human is flagged `sandbox` all the way onto the chain so a rating
that counts them says how much of its human depth is demo. Needs a signer:
``ACR_POSTER_PRIVATE_KEY`` or the Circle poster wallet, the same wallet that
signs oracle prints. Needs ``ACR_HUMANID_SALT``, which must hash to the
commitment the mirror was deployed with — checked here, because a wrong salt
derives cluster ids that match nothing and every surface would then read "no
humans" while every transaction succeeded.

Exit codes: 0 = the tape is up to date (something was resolved, or everything
already was); 1 = it could not be brought up to date — no address, no signer, no
salt, a salt that disagrees with the chain, or an unreachable node. "Nothing to
resolve" is the normal steady state of a recurring chore, so it is a success.
