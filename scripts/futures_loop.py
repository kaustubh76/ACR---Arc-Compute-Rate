"""Keep the live ACR futures book moving — a bounded, mean-reverting taker loop.

Trades the seeded series on a timer so the public desk (arc-compute-rate.vercel.app
/curve) shows a *living* market: inventory oscillating, open interest changing.
Only the TAKER trades — every fill auto-mirrors the maker — so one funded key
drives the whole book.

    LOOP_INTERVAL=120 LOOP_DURATION=4h LOOP_MAX_TRADES=100 LOOP_BAND=4 \
    uv run python scripts/futures_loop.py            # add --once for a single trade

Safety rails (cannot drain the wallet, breach margin, or run away):
  • mean-reverting qty, hard-clamped to a band that stays inside posted margin
  • gas-floor stop • max-trades + max-duration caps • per-iteration try/except
