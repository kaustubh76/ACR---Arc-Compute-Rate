"""Generate the sandbox's decision fixtures BY RUNNING THE LADDER.

    uv run python scripts/gen_sandbox_decisions.py          # write the fixture
    uv run python scripts/gen_sandbox_decisions.py --check  # exit 1 if stale

WHY THIS EXISTS. The six sandbox rows were typed by hand, and one of them
described a decision the ladder cannot produce: `inv-0044` claimed *"140 USDC is
at or above the 100 per-payment limit, so the owner signs this one"* while
carrying `par_usdc: null`. With no benchmark and a bill of 140 against the 1
USDC unbenchmarked ceiling, check 5 returns first — the per-transaction rule at
check 8 is unreachable. The row was a plausible sentence about a decision that
never happened, rendered in the escalation queue, which cannot be shown at all
without a sandbox.

A demonstration the code cannot produce is the one kind of demo this project
cannot ship. So the fixture is no longer written; it is DERIVED. Each row below
states the inputs and the state it is meant to show, `decide()` produces the
row, and `--check` fails the build if the two drift apart.

The sandbox is still a demonstration — `businesses.json` says so and
`businesses.real()` keeps it out of every traction figure. What changes is that
it is now a demonstration of the real ladder rather than of a sentence.
