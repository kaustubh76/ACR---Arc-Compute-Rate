"""Turn an x402 payment into an on-chain right.

Circle Gateway settles nanopayments off-chain and returns a batch UUID. No
contract can see that, so "this wallet paid for the feed" lives only in the
seller's ledger. Asked directly, Circle's answer was that you would need "an
EIP-712 signed attestation or oracle receipt to cryptographically verify the
off-chain x402 payment on-chain". This mints exactly that.

The seller reads its OWN settlement ledger, signs a `FeedAccess` struct with the
same Circle developer-controlled wallet that signs oracle prints, and anyone can
relay it to `FeedAccessAttestor.redeem`. After that, `hasFeedAccess(addr)` is a
fact any other contract can branch on — a futures venue could rebate fees to
wallets that paid for the index, which is the point.

**The seller signs; it does not decide.** Every attestation is derived from rows
already in the public ledger at `/marketplace/receipts`. This script cannot mint
access for a wallet that has not paid, because it has nowhere to get the payer
from except the settlements themselves — which is what makes the receipt worth
believing rather than merely worth verifying.

Two addresses, one agent, and the reason `payer` and `beneficiary` are separate
fields: an x402 `exact` settlement is signed by an EOA (the facilitator
`ecrecover`s EIP-3009), so a Circle agent wallet pays from its BACKING EOA while
its smart account is what trades. Access follows the beneficiary.

    ATTESTOR_ADDRESS=0x… uv run python scripts/attest_feed_access.py \
        --beneficiary 0x1Dc707E3…          # who gets the access
    ATTEST_DRY_RUN=1 …                     # sign + print, broadcast nothing

Exit codes: 0 = an attestation was minted (or the dry run produced one);
1 = the payer has no settlements, or nothing could sign.
