"""Mirror settled x402 receipts onto ReceiptMirror, so the subgraph has a tape.

Circle Gateway settles off-chain and returns a batch UUID, not a transaction, so
nothing on Arc records that a payment happened. Without this there is no
settlement event to index, and transaction-cost analysis has no basis at all.

The service runs this continuously as a keeper chore; this script is the
operator's copy of the same code path — for a first run, a backlog, or a check.

    ACR_RECEIPT_MIRROR_ADDRESS=0x… uv run python scripts/mirror_receipts.py --dry-run
    ACR_RECEIPT_MIRROR_ADDRESS=0x… uv run python scripts/mirror_receipts.py

Reads the seller's own public ledger (``/marketplace/receipts``) by default, or
a local JSONL with ``--ledger``. Needs a signer: ``ACR_POSTER_PRIVATE_KEY`` or
the Circle poster wallet — the same wallet that signs oracle prints, so the tape
and the prints it is measured against share one trust anchor.

Exit codes: 0 = the tape is up to date (something was mirrored, or there was
nothing eligible left to mirror); 1 = it could not be brought up to date — no
address, no signer, or an unreadable ledger. "Nothing to mirror" is the normal
steady state of a recurring chore, so it is a success: a wrapper that treats a
caught-up mirror as a failure teaches its operator to ignore the exit code.
