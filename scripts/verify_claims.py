"""Check that the numbers in the README are still true.

This project's whole argument is that its claims are true, and its front door
states them. But numbers written into prose rot silently: every figure this
script found stale was correct the day it was typed, and nothing in the repo
noticed when the suites grew past it. `verify_live.py` proves the deployed
product; this proves the documentation.

The claims are **parsed out of the docs** and re-measured, rather than compared
against a second hardcoded list — a checker that carries its own copy of the
answer is a mirror, and drifts in step with whatever it was meant to catch.

Measuring costs real time (it collects the test suites), so the expensive checks
are skippable for a quick pass:

    uv run python scripts/verify_claims.py          # == make verify-claims
    CLAIMS_FAST=1 …                                 # skip suite collection

Hackathon-era documents (hackathon/) were audited once and are now frozen;
only what a user reads is held to reality.

Exit codes: 0 = every claim still holds; 1 = the README is lying.
