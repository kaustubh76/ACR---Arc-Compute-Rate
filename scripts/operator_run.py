"""Run the spend operator for one registered business.

    uv run python scripts/operator_run.py --business acr-fleet
    uv run python scripts/operator_run.py --business acr-fleet --live   # pays
    uv run python scripts/operator_run.py --business acme --entitlements bills.json

THE SECOND SOURCE. `--entitlements` reads bills that did NOT come through our
paywall — a recurring vendor's invoice for fifty seats, a contractor's milestone
— each one paired with an independent count of what was actually used. That is
Prior Art #06 applied where it is worth the most: the agoranomoi kept the
standard measures because a seller who supplies both the goods and the measuring
cup will eventually supply a smaller cup, and a SaaS invoice arrives already
totalled.

A business with NO `PolicyWallet` is a first-class case here, not a degraded
one: the operator prices, meters and reports, and cannot spend. The registry
calls that "what an evaluation looks like", and it is the whole of what a new
customer has to trust us with — a usage export, and no keys.

WHAT AN OBLIGATION IS HERE, and why it is not invented. The fleet's own
settlement archive says which machine services it consumed and how much of each.
The marketplace catalog says what each seller is asking for those same services
right now. One obligation per (seller, resource) the fleet actually bought from:
*this seller wants this price for a service we really consume, and we have our
own count of how much we took*. Nothing is synthesised — the vendor, the
resource, the quantity and the price all come from records that existed before
this script ran.

DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT, and with no PolicyWallet configured it is the only mode:
the operator prices and meters and writes down what it would do. `--live` is
refused unless the business has a wallet, because a "live" run that silently
could not pay would be a dry run wearing the wrong label.

The decisions this writes are what `/spend` reads. They are also the honest
Tameion delta for this business: its settlements predate the window, every
decision here does not.
