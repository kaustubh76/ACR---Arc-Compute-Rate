"""Gate: every uncommon term on the architecture diagram must be defined in the glossary.

Extracts candidate technical tokens from `acr_architecture.excalidraw`, drops the
ones that are plainly common English / filenames / zone-title fragments (an
explicit allowlist), and asserts each remaining token appears in
`docs/GLOSSARY.md`. Exits non-zero and prints the gaps if any term is undefined —
so "explain every uncommon term" can't silently drift as the diagram evolves.
