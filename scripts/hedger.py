"""The autonomous hedger — an agent that buys the index, then acts on it.

This is the loop the whole project exists to make possible, run end to end by
one wallet with no human in it:

    1. PAY   a real x402 nanopayment for the latest ACR-INF print
    2. READ  its own on-chain position on the futures venue
    3. DECIDE how far it is from the hedge its mandate asks for
    4. TRADE the difference on ACRFutures — a real fill on the public tape

Every other agent in this repo does one leg. The buyer pays but never acts on
what it bought; the heartbeat trades but never pays for the data it trades on.
Neither is an economic decision. This one is: the print it purchases is the
input to the position it takes — and that join belongs to the venue, not to
this script. ``ACRFutures.trade`` fills at ``oracle.latestValue(indexId)``, so
the number this agent paid for IS the number it was filled at, whatever this
file happens to write down.

Which matters, because the log below is a DIAGNOSTIC and not evidence. It
lands in ``data/``, which is gitignored and dockerignored, so it never leaves
the machine that ran it — and ``print_tx`` was null on all seven of its first
live lines while the payments themselves succeeded (see ``buy_the_print``).
The claim a stranger can check is ``GET /hedger``: the Gateway settlements
this wallet made, beside the position they bought, one from the public
receipts tape and one from the chain. Write this log for yourself; point other
people at that.

## Why a Circle AGENT wallet, and not the ones the venue uses

The maker, taker and press are Circle **developer-controlled** wallets because
they run from cron and an OTP session would expire on them (docs/WALLETS.md).
This agent is the opposite case — it is the thing Circle's agent wallet was
built for: "a programmatic USDC wallet for AI agents … to pay for x402
services". So it signs through the Circle CLI and holds no exportable key:

    circle services pay <url> --address <agent> --chain ARC-TESTNET
    circle wallet execute "trade(uint256,int256)" <series> <qty> …

That also settles a question this repo had answered too broadly. The runbook
says an x402 buyer "needs a raw, exportable EOA key" because the `exact` scheme
is EIP-3009 and the facilitator `ecrecover`s it. True when OUR code signs — but
when the CLI pays, Circle signs through the agent wallet's backing EOA and
nothing is exported. Both designs are valid; this is the one with no key.

## The guardrails, and an honest note about them

Circle agent wallets support platform-enforced spending policies — per-tx,
daily, weekly and monthly caps the CLI itself refuses to exceed. They are
**mainnet-only**; the testnet chains this runs on reject them. So every limit
below is enforced by this script, which means it is only as good as this script.
That is a weaker claim than "the platform will not let it overspend" and it is
written here so nobody upgrades it in the retelling.

What is enforced:

  * a per-run USDC spend cap, passed to the CLI as `--max-amount` too, so the
    payment layer refuses independently of our arithmetic;
  * a hard position cap in contracts;
  * a gas floor — on Arc USDC *is* gas, so a wallet spent to zero cannot exit;
  * a kill switch checked before every action;
  * sizing through the desk's own ``feasible_qty``, the same clamp a reader
    gets, so the agent cannot ask for a fill the contract would revert.

A breach REFUSES rather than silently clamping. A guardrail that quietly
shrinks your order teaches you nothing; one that stops and says why is a fact
you can act on.

    uv run python scripts/hedger.py --once            # == make hedger
    HEDGER_DRY_RUN=1 uv run python scripts/hedger.py  # decide, never spend
    HEDGER_TARGET=-2 …                                # the mandate, in contracts

Exit codes: 0 = the loop ran and every decision was honoured (including a
deliberate refusal); 1 = it could not run (no wallet, no venue, chain unreadable).
