"""The venue's roll, proven against a REAL ACRFutures deployment.

``futures_roll.py`` is what keeps the venue alive across an expiry: it opens the
successor series and collateralizes the maker. If it fails, the current series
expires with nothing behind it, ``_live_series`` starts raising 409 "no open
series", and the entire trading surface — desk, tape, curve skew — goes dark.

It had never been exercised. Every scheduled run so far reported "nothing to
roll", because the live series always had life left, so the branch that
*actually does the work* had run exactly once, by hand, months of chain-time
ago. The first real test of that path was scheduled to be production.

So this runs **the script itself**, as a subprocess, against a genuine
deployment on anvil — not a reimplementation of its logic, because CI runs the
script and the script is what must work. Skipped (not failed) without anvil, so
the default `make test` stays hermetic.

    make anvil                     # or: anvil &
    uv run pytest services/index_api/tests/test_futures_roll_onchain.py -q
