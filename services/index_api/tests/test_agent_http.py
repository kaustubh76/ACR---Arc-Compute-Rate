"""The card over real HTTP — the proof that was missing.

`test_agentgate.py` drives `AgentGate.verify` through a hand-rolled request stub,
which is the right way to reach every refusal but proves nothing about the wiring:
before this file, **no test anywhere sent an `AGENT-CARD` header over HTTP**, and
that is exactly why the gate sat on one route of forty-two without anyone noticing.

Three things only a TestClient can establish:

  * a dependency that raises becomes a 401 RESPONSE rather than a 500,
  * the rate-limit ident the route actually passes is the cluster, not the key,
  * an anonymous caller on the newly carded routes is charged nothing at all.

Named `test_agent_http` deliberately — it sorts BEFORE `test_agentgate.py`, which
pins `index_api.agentgate.current_window` globally and never restores it. The
mirror stub here ignores the window for the same reason, so neither file can
decide the other's outcome.
