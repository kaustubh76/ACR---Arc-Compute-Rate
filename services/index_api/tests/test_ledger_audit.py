"""Each of the six, with the error planted in front of it.

A check that has never caught anything is a claim, not a control. Every test
here puts one of the essay's six errors into otherwise clean books and asserts
the audit finds it — and then asserts the clean books come back clean, because a
check that fires on everything is just as useless as one that never fires.

The through-line: **every planted error balances.** Not one of these would be
caught by summing the postings, which is why the module exists.
