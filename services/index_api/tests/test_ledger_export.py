"""Beancount export — a real double-entry file, and nothing invented.

Prior Art #01: beancount is "a ledger an agent can write to", and "neither has
ever been connected to money that actually moves." So the claim under test is
not "we emit something beancount-shaped" — it is that every transaction sums to
zero, that nothing which did not move money becomes a transaction, and that each
entry carries what *Agents and Ledgers* says a balanced ledger cannot check:
which vendor, which invoice, and whether a retry paid twice.

`test_the_balance_checker_can_actually_fail` is here because a validator that
never fails is not a validator.
