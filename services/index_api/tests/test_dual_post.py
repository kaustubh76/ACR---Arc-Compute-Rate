"""Dual-post tests — the migration's safety property, as a test not a paragraph.

Two oracles run side by side: v1 because `ACRFutures` settles against it and its
oracle pointer is immutable, v2 because it carries the policy hash and window
that make a print reproducible. The asymmetry between them is the whole design:

  * v1 stale  → `ACRFutures.settle()` refuses a print older than two hours, so
    every expired open series becomes unsettleable and its collateral sits
    stranded. A v1 failure must abort the cycle, exactly as before.
  * v2 stale  → the subgraph's arrival ring goes sparse, which it already
    reports honestly as `benchmarked: false`. A v2 failure must be recorded and
    stepped over.

A tape problem must never be able to stop the press.
