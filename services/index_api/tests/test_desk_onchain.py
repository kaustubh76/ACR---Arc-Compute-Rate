"""The desk's exit path, proven against the REAL ACRFutures contract.

Everything here runs against a genuine deployment on a local anvil node — the
same contract bytecode that is live on Arc, driven through the same
``FuturesClient`` and the same ``desk.withdrawable()`` the API serves. Nothing
about the venue is stood in for.

That distinction matters for this feature specifically. ``withdrawable()``'s job
is to predict what ``withdrawCollateral`` will accept, and a stubbed client can
only ever confirm that the prediction matches *itself*. The assertions below
compare the prediction against what the contract actually does — withdrawing the
quoted amount must move real tokens, and one unit past the contract's own limit
must revert. A fake cannot fail those, and this suite already has: the first
version asserted that a unit past the *quote* would revert, which is false,
because the safety haircut deliberately leaves the quote below the limit.

Skipped (not failed) when anvil isn't up or the contracts aren't built, so the
default `make test` stays hermetic and credential-free.
