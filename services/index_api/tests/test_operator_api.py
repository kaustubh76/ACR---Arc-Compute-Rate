"""The operator endpoints over HTTP — not just the modules beneath them.

`test_statement.py` and `test_businesses.py` cover the builders. This file
covers the two routes, because a surface tested only through its own internals
is where a presence test passes on a deleted pillar: the module can be perfect
while the route is unregistered, mis-wired, or quietly serving a field it must
not.

The claim this file exists to defend over HTTP is the same one `statement.py`
enforces internally: `payer_tca`'s `overpaid_usdc` is a real number about a
synthetic scale (`anchors/GAP.md` puts the index reference level 20x to 1250x
off market), so it must never reach an owner's page. Asserting it inside the
builder is not enough — the route is what the world reads.
