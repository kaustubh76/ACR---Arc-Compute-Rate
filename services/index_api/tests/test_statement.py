"""The Spend Statement — and the dollar figure that must never appear on it.

The headline test is ``test_the_indexs_dollar_figure_never_reaches_the_owner``.
``payer_tca`` returns ``overpaid_usdc``, derived from slippage against the ACR
arrival print, whose reference level ``anchors/GAP.md`` records as 20x to 1250x
off real market prices. The bp figures from that call are scale-invariant and
fine; the USDC one is a real number about a synthetic scale, and on an owner's
page it would read as money.
