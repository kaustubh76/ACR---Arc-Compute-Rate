"""Terminal payload chain block, /health wiring card, sim ledger, offline bundle.

Covers the frontend contract for the crypto-rich offline edition:
  * build_terminal_payload's ``chain`` block (exact keys — the Terminal's
    network identity card),
  * ``build_sim_receipts`` == ``build_receipts`` shape (honest sim labeling),
  * the enriched /health fields,
  * ``scripts/gen_snapshot.py``'s embedded bundle sections
    (marketplace / revenue / x402 / x402_exchange_sample).
