"""The screen on agent-to-agent traffic — send AND receive, and fail closed.

An agent gateway has two jobs a payment gate does not: refuse a REQUEST that is
trying to talk past the model, and refuse a REPLY that carries something hostile
back. Both directions or neither — screening only what arrives leaves the reply
path as the way in, and screening only what leaves assumes the other side is
friendly.

Google Cloud Model Armor does exactly this pair, so the seam maps onto it
one-to-one rather than inventing a vocabulary:

    screen_request()  ->  :sanitizeUserPrompt
    screen_reply()    ->  :sanitizeModelResponse

WHY A SERVICE ACCOUNT AND NOT A KEY. Model Armor is IAM-gated: it takes an
OAuth2 bearer token from a service account or ADC, and it rejects API keys
outright, because an API key carries no IAM role for `roles/modelarmor.user` to
attach to. Measured, not assumed — the project's console offers keys, and none of
them can reach this API.

And ADC is not a deployment credential. `gcloud auth application-default login`
writes a USER credential: it works on a developer's laptop and is worthless in CI
or on a container host. So the configured path is a service-account JSON file,
and `armor_credentials_file` holds a PATH rather than the JSON, because
`ACRSettings` reads `.env` and `.env` is the file most likely to be pasted into
an issue.

FAIL CLOSED, and that is the whole reason this is not a try/except that shrugs.
`CircleFacilitator` raises on a facilitator timeout rather than admitting an
unpaid request; a screen has the same duty and a sharper one. A screen that
allows traffic it could not inspect has not degraded gracefully — it has stopped
being a screen while continuing to report that it is one.
