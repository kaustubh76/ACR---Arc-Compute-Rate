"""Machine TCA — transaction-cost analysis for agents, read from the tape.

Every institutional desk runs TCA on its fills. No AI agent ever has, because
there was no benchmark to compare a machine purchase against. ACR publishes one,
and the subgraph records what each payer actually paid against the print they
could have seen when they paid — so the comparison is a query, not a claim.

Everything here reads the **mapping-computed** rollups (`SellerDay`, `PayerDay`)
rather than recomputing from raw settlements. That is the point: `slippageBp` is
derived inside the subgraph mappings from indexed chain data, and this layer only
aggregates and grades. If this file computed slippage itself, the number would be
ACR's arithmetic over ACR's data — which is exactly the thing a benchmark is not
allowed to be.

**Unavailable is not zero.** When the subgraph is unset or unreachable, every
surface here says so explicitly. A TCA of "+0 bp" and a TCA of "we could not read
the tape" are different facts, and rendering one as the other is the failure mode
that would matter most.
