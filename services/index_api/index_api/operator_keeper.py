"""The spend operator, running without being asked.

RFB 4 asks for "obligations settled on time **without a human touching them**",
and until now the honest answer was that the design permits it: the spend path
had exactly one entry point, `scripts/operator_run.py`, reachable only from
`make operator-run`. Nothing in the press, no route and no workflow ever called
it. An agent somebody has to trigger is a tool.

WHY HERE AND NOT IN GITHUB ACTIONS. This repo already decided that, in writing.
`futures-heartbeat.yml` and `futures-lifecycle.yml` both carry
`── RETIRED FROM THE SCHEDULE 2026-08-03 ──`: the job moved into the press
because a scheduled Actions run would need `ACR_CIRCLE_ENTITY_SECRET`, "a
credential that controls every developer-controlled wallet, INCLUDING the one
that signs oracle prints — a strictly larger blast radius than the scoped raw
key it would replace". A cron'd `operator-run --live` needs the policy agent key
in CI: the same trade, refused for the same reason. And independently, GitHub
cron fires only from the default branch, so a workflow on a feature branch is
not a scheduled job at all — `docs/TESTNET_RUNBOOK.md` records that costing days
of a dead book.

THE THREE RULES THIS INHERITS from `keeper.py`, which is the venue's version of
the same problem — a recurring job that moves money on a host that holds the
credentials:

1. it can never take the press down;
2. it does nothing without custody;
3. a cooldown bounds every write.

AND ONE OF ITS OWN: **off by default.** `ACR_OPERATOR_AUTORUN` is `off`, `dry`
or `live`, and `off` is what every checkout gets. A money loop that is armed
unless you remember to disarm it is not a guardrail. `dry` exists because the
first question about any new loop is "does it tick at all on that host?", and
that question should be answerable before the first payment rather than after.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY WILL NOT DO. It never calls `spend_as_owner`. Clearing an
escalation is the one thing a human is for, it stays behind the token-gated
`POST /ops/actions`, and `traction.py` keys "settled without a human touching
them" on the `actor` field — so a loop that approved its own escalations would
not be more autonomous, it would make the autonomy figure mean nothing.
