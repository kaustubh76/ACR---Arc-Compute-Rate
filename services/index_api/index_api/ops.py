"""The systems ledger — what the operator knows, served instead of typed.

``scripts/verify_live.py`` answers "is the thing on the internet working right
now?" by probing the deployment from OUTSIDE, over HTTP, from a laptop. That is
the right shape for a gate and it stays exactly as it is: unchanged, still the
CI/``make verify-live`` path, still the only thing that can catch a Vercel route
serving a 500 or a cron GitHub silently dropped.

This module answers a different question — "what does the press itself
currently believe?" — from INSIDE the process, over state it already holds.
The distinction matters and is not a technicality:

  * An in-process checker must not HTTP-probe its own API. A check that curls
    ``/prints`` from the process serving ``/prints`` proves the socket is open
    and nothing else; on a free-tier host it also competes with the requests it
    is meant to be reassuring you about.
  * The expensive reads (venue scan, oracle prints) are ALREADY memoized by the
    warm loop. Reporting off those memos costs approximately nothing, where a
    fresh probe of each would be the most expensive thing the service does.
  * verify_live must fail loudly on a laptop. This must never fail at all — it
    is a dashboard, and a dashboard that can take the press down with it is
    worse than no dashboard.

So: no writes, no chain calls of its own beyond the shared readers, every
section wrapped, and an honest ``unknown`` wherever a read did not land. Unread
is never rendered as zero — that is the same rule the Terminal lives by, and it
is exactly as load-bearing here, where a zeroed panel reads as an outage.
