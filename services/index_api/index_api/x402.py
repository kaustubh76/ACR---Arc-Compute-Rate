"""x402 payment gate — the self-referential business model.

The index about machine commerce is bought BY machines. Every gated query is
behind an HTTP 402 Payment Required: an agent presents an x402 payment header,
the facilitator verifies (and settles) it, and the data is served. Every paid
query is simultaneously revenue and a Nanopayments dogfooding datapoint.

Two facilitators, selected by config:
  * ``DevFacilitator`` (default) — accepts a well-formed mock header
    ``x402 <payer>:<amount>`` so the loop is demonstrable offline.
  * ``CircleFacilitator`` — real x402 v2: returns a base64 ``PAYMENT-REQUIRED``
    (a PaymentRequirements object, ``exact``/GatewayWalletBatched scheme on Arc),
    then on retry POSTs the ``PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`` payload to the Circle Gateway
    facilitator's ``POST /v1/x402/verify`` + ``/v1/x402/settle`` and gates on
    the result. Fail-closed: any error → 402 (never serve unpaid).

Both facilitators raise the challenge as a :class:`PaymentRequired` carrying
the Gateway-shaped ``{"x402Version": 2, "resource": {...}, "accepts": [...]}``
JSON body — what x402 client SDKs parse (``x402Version`` MUST be 2 and
``resource`` MUST be an object, or Circle's Gateway API rejects the payload
shape) — which ``app.py`` renders via an exception handler. The legacy
``X-402-*`` / base64 ``PAYMENT-REQUIRED`` headers are kept alongside (the
Terminal console reads them).
