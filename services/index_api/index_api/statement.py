"""The Spend Statement — what the owner reads, and what it is allowed to claim.

THE ONE SEPARATION THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE. Two different benchmarks are in
play and only one of them may be denominated in dollars:

  SAVINGS, in USDC, come from the operator's own decision log, where every
  figure is the gap between a price billed and a price another seller was
  actually offering for the same service. Real money, available elsewhere.

  MARKET CONTEXT, in basis points only, comes from ``payer_tca``, which measures
  against the ACR arrival print. ``anchors/GAP.md`` records that print's
  reference level sitting 20x to 1159x off real market prices, so its bp figures
  are meaningful (they are exactly scale-invariant — GAP.md re-anchored ACR-INF
  667x without the error moving) while its **USDC** figures are not.

So ``payer_tca``'s ``overpaid_usdc`` is deliberately NOT forwarded. It is a real
number about a synthetic scale, and on an owner-facing page it would read as
money. The bp figures from the same call are forwarded, labelled as context.

If that distinction is ever collapsed — one "total saved" adding the two — the
statement starts making a claim the repo's own anchor report contradicts, and
that report is public.
