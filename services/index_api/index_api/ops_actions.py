"""Operator actions — the Makefile's money-moving targets, behind a key.

Everything here was a terminal ritual: settle the expired series, roll to a
fresh one, deepen the book, move USDC to the wallet that ran dry. The scripts
that do these things are still the reference implementations and still exist;
this is the subset an operator needs to reach from a phone when the venue is
degraded and there is no laptop.

Four rules hold regardless of what the UI sends, because a UI is not a
security boundary:

  1. **Disabled by default.** With no ``ACR_OPS_TOKEN`` set, the action routes
     404 — not 401. An endpoint that admits it exists is an endpoint worth
     guessing at, and the overwhelmingly common deployment wants none of this.
  2. **Dry-run is the default.** Every action prices itself and reports what it
     WOULD do unless the caller explicitly passes ``dry_run: false``. A missing
     field can therefore never spend money; only a present one can.
  3. **Caps are enforced here, not in the form.** The per-run USDC ceilings
     below are the same ones the scripts enforce, and they bind even if the
     request asks for more.
  4. **Everything is written down.** Every attempt — refused, dry-run or
     executed — appends to the audit log before the caller sees the result.

What is deliberately NOT here: ``setSigner``, ``transferOwnership``, and
contract deploys. Those change who controls the system rather than what it is
doing, they are needed roughly once, and a bearer token is not the right key
for them. They stay with the deploy scripts and a human.
