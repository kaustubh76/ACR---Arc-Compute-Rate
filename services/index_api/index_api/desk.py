"""The Public Desk — terminal visitors trade ACRFutures with a Circle
user-controlled wallet (SCA on Arc Testnet, Gas Station-sponsored gas).

Backend half of the challenge-response model: this module mints Circle users /
session tokens, initializes SCA wallets on ``ARC-TESTNET``, drips a capped
USDC collateral stake from the custody wallet, and creates contractExecution
challenges (approve / postCollateral / trade). The frontend Web SDK
(`@circle-fin/w3s-pw-web-sdk`) executes the challengeIds — the user's PIN
authorizes every on-chain action; this server never holds their key.

All Circle calls go through :func:`_circle` (REST, httpx) — the SDK is
Node-only and the shapes are small. Guardrails live HERE, not in the UI:
faucet caps, qty clamps, trader-roster headroom.
