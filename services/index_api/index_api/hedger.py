"""The autonomous hedger's public state, derived entirely from public data.

``scripts/hedger.py`` runs wherever an operator runs it — a laptop, a dispatched
workflow — and writes its decision log there. None of that is reachable from
this service, and shipping a log file around would make the Terminal's picture
depend on a file nobody can verify.

So this derives the whole thing from what anyone can already check: the agent's
position and collateral on the venue, the ``Traded`` events whose taker is the
agent, and the x402 receipts whose payer is the agent. A reader can reproduce
every number here from the chain and the public ledger, which is the only kind
of claim this project makes.

Two addresses, one agent — the detail that trips people up (docs/WALLETS.md):

* the **SCA** (``ACR_HEDGER_ADDRESS``) is what ``ACRFutures.trade`` records as
  the taker, because it reads ``msg.sender``;
* the **backing EOA** (``ACR_HEDGER_PAYER``) is what the x402 settlement
  records, because EIP-3009 needs a signature ``ecrecover`` can verify and
  Circle signs with that EOA.

Both are the same agent. Unset either and the surface honestly reports itself
as not configured rather than inventing an empty agent.
