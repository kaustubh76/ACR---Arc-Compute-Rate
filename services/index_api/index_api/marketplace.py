"""Agent-marketplace surfaces — machine-readable listings + the settlement ledger.

``/marketplace/catalog`` lists every x402-gated endpoint in the shape agents
already parse in the wild (the x402 "Bazaar" item: ``{resource, type,
x402Version, accepts, metadata}``), so a buyer agent can discover, price, and
pay ACR services without human configuration. The on-chain
``AttestationRegistry`` doubles as the listing's reputation anchor (the
ERC-8004 idea — identity + attested quality metadata — surfaced here as
``metadata.provider.attestation``): a cautious buyer can require attested
sellers before paying.

``/marketplace/receipts`` is the public settlement ledger: the facilitator's
ring of recent :class:`~index_api.x402.PaymentReceipt` rows, newest first.
Receipts carry a monotone ``seq`` ordinal, deliberately not a wall-clock time
(prints and the Terminal narrate in Fixing numbers, never dates).

Offline-invariant: with no ``ACR_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`` the registry seam is a
``NullRegistry`` and ``provider.attestation`` is ``null`` — the catalog itself
never needs chain, Circle, or credentials.

    """The public settlement ledger — the facilitator's recent-receipt ring,
    newest first, with a monotone ``seq`` ordinal.

    Carries ``settled_at`` when the receipt has one. The ledger now rehydrates
    real Gateway settlements from a committed archive, so some rows are
    genuinely old — and a ledger that shows *what* was paid while hiding *when*
    invites a reader to assume it was recent. The row is true either way; the
    timestamp is what makes it unambiguous. (Omitted when zero, so a receipt
    from before the field existed does not claim to have settled at the epoch.)

    Carries ``resource`` on the same terms. ``PaymentReceipt`` has stamped the
    bought path since the field was added, but this builder dropped it, so the
    catalog could list thirteen resources and the tape could prove thirty-four
    settlements with nothing joining the two — the marketplace had listings and
    sales and no way to say which listing sold. Emitted only when non-empty:
    most archived rows predate the stamp, and an empty string rendered as a
    resource would attribute every one of them to the same nameless listing.
