"""The venue keeper, running where the credentials already are.

The heartbeat trade and the series roll used to run in GitHub Actions from raw
private keys. Now that the venue signs through Circle custody, the same jobs in
CI would need ``ACR_CIRCLE_ENTITY_SECRET`` — a credential that controls **every**
developer-controlled wallet, including the one that signs oracle prints. That is
a strictly larger blast radius than the scoped key it would replace, so moving
the jobs to CI's credential is the wrong direction. Move the jobs instead.

This service already holds those credentials, already runs a 60-second loop, and
already posts hourly prints with them. Adding the venue's two chores here means
**no signing credential in CI at all** — see docs/WALLETS.md.

Three rules this module lives by, because it shares a process with the press:

1. **It can never take the press down.** Every entry point is wrapped by the
   caller and every failure is swallowed after logging. A venue that stops
   trading is a degraded demo; a press that stops printing is a dead product,
   and the contract will not settle against a stale print.
2. **It does nothing without custody.** If the maker/taker roles do not resolve
   to Circle wallets it returns immediately rather than reaching for an ambient
   key — the exact fallback that kept the venue on a raw EOA for weeks.
3. **Cooldowns bound every write.** A failing chore retried each 60s tick would
   burn gas and RPC budget to keep failing.

``ACR_KEEPER=0`` disables the whole thing without a deploy.
