"""The GraphQL transport — one place, so nothing can drift.

Both the estimator's tape source and the API's TCA surfaces read the same
subgraph. Two transports would eventually differ in a timeout, an auth header or
an error convention, and the symptom would be two ACR surfaces disagreeing about
the same public data — which is the one thing a benchmark cannot afford.

``urllib`` rather than httpx deliberately: nothing else in ``packages/`` carries
an HTTP dependency, and a tape adapter is not the place to add one to the
estimator's install.
