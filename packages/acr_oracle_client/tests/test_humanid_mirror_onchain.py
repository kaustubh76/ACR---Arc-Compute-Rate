"""HumanIdMirror round-trip — runs only when a local anvil node is reachable.

Deploys the real compiled contract and drives it through `HumanIdMirrorClient`
exactly as `scripts/resolve_humans.py` does. Skipped (not failed) without a node,
so the default `make test` stays hermetic.

The claims under test are the ones only a real chain can settle: that a repeat
resolution is a no-op rather than a revert (the resolver is a loop that reruns),
that provenance cannot be flipped from sandbox to verified, and that our
off-chain EIP-712 encoding produces the byte-identical digest the contract
computes — asserted against `resolutionDigest` rather than against a
reimplementation of it, because agreeing with ourselves proves nothing.
