"""ReceiptMirror round-trip — runs only when a local anvil node is reachable.

Deploys the real compiled ReceiptMirror, mirrors a settlement through
``MirrorClient`` exactly as the keeper does, and reads the record back. Skipped
(not failed) without a node, so the default `make test` stays hermetic.

The claim under test is the one the two-phase design exists to make: the arrival
anchor is committed in phase 1 and is out of reach in phase 2. Asserted against
a real chain rather than a mock, because the guard that enforces it is a
`require` in Solidity — a stub would only prove the stub agrees with itself.
