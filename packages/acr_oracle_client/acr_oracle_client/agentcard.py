"""The agent card — who is calling, signed, with no registry to ask.

An agent presents a card. The card says which key it is, what role it is acting
in, which service it is for, and until when. The gate recovers the signature and
believes the key, not a list — so nobody has to be enrolled, and there is no
registry to run, gatekeep, or lose.

THE DOMAIN OMITS `verifyingContract`, AND THAT IS WHAT PERMISSIONLESS MEANS HERE.
The four domains this project already has — `ACR Oracle`,
`ACR AttestationRegistry`, `ACR Receipt Mirror`, `ACR Human Id Mirror` — each bind
to a deployed address, because each is verified BY that contract. A card is
verified by whoever reads it, so there is no address to name.

That buys openness and costs two things, both paid for in the struct rather than
hoped away:

  * A `{name, version, chainId}` domain is valid at ANY verifier on that chain.
    So the card carries `audience`, and a gate refuses a card addressed elsewhere.
    Without it, a card minted for some other ACR-domain service would be
    presentable here — which is precisely the replay a `verifyingContract`
    normally prevents.

  * A bearer credential is replayable inside its validity window by anyone who
    captures it. So `MAX_TTL_S` bounds that window. There is no per-call nonce on
    purpose: an agent cannot afford a round trip before every request, and the
    AgentKit verifier in this same codebase made the same call — freshness lives
    inside the signed message rather than in a table on our side.

AND A CARD PROVES IDENTITY, NOT SCARCITY. Keys are free, so a caller who wants
ten identities can have them, and a rate limit keyed on the agent address is
evadable by anyone willing to run `eth-account` in a loop. That is why
`humanCluster` exists: a card may CLAIM a human, the gate checks that claim
against `HumanIdMirror.clusterOf` on chain, and the limit keys on the human. Ten
keys belonging to one person then buy one budget. The claim is worth nothing
unverified, which is why this module only carries it and `agentgate` is the thing
that checks it.
