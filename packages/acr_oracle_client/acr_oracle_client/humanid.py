"""Human cluster ids — the grouping key the tape publishes instead of a nullifier.

`HumanIdMirror` never sees a World ID nullifier. What it records is

    clusterId = keccak256(abi.encode(nullifier, SERVICE_SALT, window))

computed here, off chain, by whoever holds the salt. Within one rotation window
the id groups a human's wallets, which is all the cleaning stack needs to cap
them together and all the tape needs to count distinct humans; across windows it
changes, so the durable identifier never reaches ARC and this tape
cannot be joined to another service's data keyed by the same human.

Rotation does NOT make a fleet unlinkable — wallets are the join key and they do
not rotate. See `contracts/src/HumanIdMirror.sol` and `docs/WORLD-MODULE.md` for
the full argument and for what would actually be required to hide the grouping.

ONE implementation, deliberately. The API derives a cluster id from a verified
proof; the resolver derives the same id when it records the wallet. If those two
disagreed by a byte, the API would look up a cluster the resolver never wrote and
every human would read as unresolved — a silent zero, not an error. So both
import from here, and `tests/test_human_window_parity.py` pins the result against
the contract's own arithmetic.
