"""``PolicyClient`` — spend a business's money through its on-chain budget.

``contracts/src/PolicyWallet.sol`` is the authority; this is its client. Two
callers, two keys, and they are not the same party:

* the **agent** submits every transaction, and is the only address the contract
  will move money for;
* the **owner** signs nothing but approvals, and only for payments at or above
  the per-transaction limit. Their signature is what makes the escalation
  threshold real rather than a flag in a database somebody can flip.

So this client holds two signers and keeps them apart. An operator that could
sign its own approvals would have no threshold at all, which is the failure this
whole contract exists to prevent — ``spend_approved`` therefore refuses when the
two signers are the same address, rather than discovering it on chain.

Mirrors ``MirrorClient``'s shape (same offline tolerance, same pre-broadcast
signature check, same ``_send``) so one reader's understanding covers both.
