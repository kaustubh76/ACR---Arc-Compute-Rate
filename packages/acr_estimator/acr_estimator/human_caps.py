"""Pillar 3, denominated in people — what it costs to move the print in HUMANS.

The published bound prices an attack in wallets, and a wallet costs a funding
transfer. That is the honest number when identity is free, and it is why the
figure is large in dollars and unimpressive in effort. Once some payers are
resolved to verified humans, a second question becomes answerable: how many
distinct PEOPLE would an attacker need standing behind the flow?

Almost none of this is new arithmetic. `bound.manipulation_bound` already prices
a cleaning-evading adversary against a per-cluster volume cap and already returns
how many capped clusters the injection needs. This supplies one thing — a
different cap for flow that is human-backed — and reads the cluster count back
out as a count of humans.

WHY A CLUSTER IS A HUMAN HERE. Under the wallet cap a "cluster" is a funding
community an attacker fabricates, so the identity count multiplies by
`SYBIL_MAX_SIZE + 1`: they must stand up a whole community to look organic. A
verified human needs no such disguise — they are already, verifiably, one person.
So the human count is `sybil_clusters_required` directly, with no evade-size
multiplier. Carrying the multiplier over would inflate the headline by ~40x,
which is the kind of error that flatters and therefore does not get questioned.

WHAT THIS NUMBER IS NOT. It is a LOWER bound, and it says so everywhere it
surfaces. `C_human` — the cost of controlling one verified identity an attacker
does not own — has no citable market rate, so `anchors/_basket/C-HUMAN.json`
carries a deliberately low floor rather than an estimate, and records that as a
finding. Understating it can only make the benchmark look weaker than it is,
which is the safe direction for a number nobody can yet source. See that file
before quoting anything derived from here.
