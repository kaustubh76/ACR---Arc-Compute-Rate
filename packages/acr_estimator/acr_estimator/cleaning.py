"""Cleaning Stack — the contamination filter that precedes estimation.

The estimator assumes contaminated data. Four defenses, all computed on the
funding graph (who paid whom, weighted by USDC notional):

  1. self-dealing   — buyer == seller.
  2. wash cycles    — reciprocal funding (A pays B *and* B pays A): a ring
                      whose net on-chain flow is ~zero but which prints volume.
  3. sybil clusters — small, self-contained communities (Louvain) that trade
                      mostly with themselves rather than the wider market.
  4. cluster caps   — no single community may contribute more than a fixed
                      fraction of window weight, bounding any one actor's pull.

The output is a per-event weight vector (zeroed for excluded flow, scaled down
for capped clusters) plus the diagnostic sets the manipulation bound consumes.
