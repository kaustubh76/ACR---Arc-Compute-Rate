"""The estimator pipeline — one estimand, four pillars, one print.

Wires the stages in the blueprint's order (③ deconvolve, ④ clean, ⑤ robust
estimate, ⑥ hedonic, ⑦ print + bound) into a single ``ACRPrint`` per index:

    events ─► clean ─► hedonic-adjust ─► robust median (+CI)
                                     └─► volume-time bars ─► Kalman deconvolution
                                     └─► manipulation bound (Pillar 3)

Also exposes ``naive_vwap`` — the contaminated volume-weighted mean — because the
whole demo is ACR (this pipeline) standing still while naive VWAP is dragged
around by wash flow.
