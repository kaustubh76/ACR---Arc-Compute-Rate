"""The mainnet guard — what must be true before the API is allowed to start on Arc mainnet.

Both gates fail OPEN in ``auto`` mode: with a facilitator URL that does not look real the
x402 gate becomes the free dev gate, and with no World app id the human tier is granted by a
verifier that cannot prove a human exists. On testnet that is a convenience. On mainnet it
means one missing environment variable gives prints away and dissolves the per-person
budget, with a log warning as the only signal. Nobody reads a log warning.

So on chain ``5042`` the service refuses to boot unless every mode is explicit and every
backend it names is configured — the failure is a stack trace at deploy time, not a quiet
week of free prints. Off mainnet the guard is a no-op, so local development is untouched.

The testnet-only money surfaces (the faucet, the demo buyer, the attack lab) are a separate
property: ``testnet_surfaces_enabled`` is FALSE on mainnet no matter what the environment
says. No variable can turn them on there, which is the point — a kill-switch that can be
flipped by a typo is not a kill-switch.
