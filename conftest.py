"""Pytest bootstrap — keep the suite hermetic and credential-free.

Tests must not depend on a developer's local ``.env`` (Circle API keys, Arc RPC,
x402 facilitator URL, …). We disable dotenv loading and strip any ``ACR_*`` env
vars before collection, so every path-selection (sim vs arc tape, dev vs Circle
facilitator, raw-key vs Circle signer) resolves to the offline default unless a
test sets it explicitly via ``monkeypatch.setenv`` + ``reset_settings()``.

# absolute 1e-12 jitter — and, larger, the SVD behind statsmodels' WLS in
# hedonic.py, which factorises a ~2500 x 5 design on every print.
# Multithreaded LAPACK blocks the factorisation
# differently per thread count, which changes the summation order and therefore
# the low bits. A suite that pins estimator output to a literal has to fix that,
# or the golden file fails on a machine with a different core count for reasons
# that have nothing to do with the engine.
