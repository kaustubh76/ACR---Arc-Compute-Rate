## The whole thing in one paragraph

Machines are starting to buy services from each other (AI inference, GPU time,
data) and pay in digital dollars (USDC) on a blockchain called **Arc**. Those
payments are messy: they arrive in delayed batches, and cheaters flood in fake
trades to make a price look higher or lower than it really is. **ACR** watches
all those payments and computes the *honest going rate* for each service —
carefully, so that fakes barely move it — then publishes that rate on-chain so
other contracts can trust it and settle against it (the way loans settle against
an interest-rate benchmark like SOFR). It also prints, next to every rate, the
literal dollar cost an attacker would have to burn to nudge it — *"here's the
bill."* Same idea as an official financial benchmark, but for machine commerce,
and it proves its own tamper-resistance.

---

## Benchmark & economics

- **Latent price / estimand** — the *true* price you can't see directly, only
  estimate from noisy data. *Like guessing a room's real temperature from a few
  cheap, laggy thermometers.*
- **Benchmark / reference rate** — one agreed, official number that lots of
  contracts settle against. *Like the "official" exchange rate a bank quotes.*
- **SOFR / LIBOR** — real-world interest-rate benchmarks banks settle loans on;
  ACR is the same idea for machine services. *The "prime rate," but for compute.*
- **VWAP (volume-weighted average price)** — a plain average that weights each
  trade by its size. Easy to fool: print huge fake volume and it follows you.
  *Like averaging house prices — one staged $10M sale drags the average.*
- **Hedonic adjustment / constant-quality (Case-Shiller)** — adjust prices so
  you compare like-for-like quality. *A cheap studio and a luxury penthouse both
  "sold" — strip the quality difference to get the true market move.*
- **Basis point (bp)** — one hundredth of one percent (0.01%). *A penny on a
  hundred dollars.*
- **Numeraire** — the unit prices are measured in (here, USDC / dollars). *The
  "ruler" you measure value with.*
- **Term structure / the curve** — prices for the same thing at different future
  dates. *Airfares for the same route next week vs next month.*

## Estimator & statistics (the four pillars)

- **Observation model / state-space** — a math model that says *"what we see =
  the true signal, distorted and delayed, plus noise."* *A muffled phone call:
  model the muffling so you can recover the words.*
- **Convolution / batching operator (H)** — the smearing/mixing of the signal
  over time because settlements arrive batched, not instantly. *Trades get
  blurred together like a long-exposure photo.*
- **Deconvolution** — undoing that smear to recover the sharp, true signal.
  *Un-blurring the photo.*
- **Kalman filter** — the standard algorithm that recovers a clean, current
  estimate of a hidden signal from noisy, delayed measurements. *Your phone's
  GPS blending laggy fixes into one smooth position.* (Pillar 1)
- **RTS smoother (Rauch–Tung–Striebel)** — a second backward pass over the Kalman
  filter that also uses *later* data to sharpen *earlier* estimates. *Re-reading
  a sentence's start once you've seen how it ends.*
- **batch operator (H)** — the mathematical object that describes how settlements
  smear trades together; the model treats it as *known* so it can be inverted.
  *The exact recipe of the blur, so you can un-blur it.*
- **WLS (weighted least squares)** — a regression that lets bigger trades count
  more than tiny ones. *Averaging exam scores but weighting the final heavier
  than a quiz.*
- **VWM (volume-weighted median)** — shorthand for the trimmed weighted median ACR
  uses; the middle value weighted by trade size. *The "typical" price, by dollars
  not by count.*
- **constant-quality rate** — the price after quality differences are stripped
  out, so it only moves when the *market* moves. *Same-model, same-mileage car
  price, tracked over time.*
- **leave-one-community-out (LOCO)** — a robustness check: drop each detected
  cluster in turn and see how far the rate moves. *Re-tallying the vote with each
  precinct removed to see who swings it.*
- **N\*** — in the attack-cost formula, the minimum wash volume (in USDC) that
  would actually move the rate by the target amount. *The smallest bribe that
  changes the outcome.*
- **fee_bp / fee_flat** — the two parts of Arc's fixed USDC transfer fee (a per-
  dollar rate + a flat per-transfer charge) that make the attack cost a number.
  *A card fee of "2% + 30¢."*
- **Volume-time bars** — sample the tape by equal dollars traded, not by equal
  clock time, so busy and quiet periods count evenly. *Weigh flour by grams, not
  by "one scoop."*
- **α-trim (trimmed) weighted median** — throw away the most extreme few percent
  on each side, then take the middle value weighted by size. Very hard to drag.
  *Olympic scoring: drop the highest and lowest judges, keep the middle.*
- **Breakdown point (½)** — how much of the data can be pure garbage before an
  estimator can be pushed anywhere. The median tolerates up to 50%. *You'd need
  to rig half the votes to flip the winner.*
- **(Weighted) bootstrap confidence interval (CI)** — resample the data many
  times to get an honest "the rate is X, give or take Y" range. *Re-polling a
  crowd repeatedly to see how much the answer wobbles.*
- **Funding graph** — the who-paid-whom network of addresses. *A map of arrows:
  who sent money to whom.*
- **Sybil / sybil cluster** — many fake identities secretly controlled by one
  attacker. *One troll with a hundred sock-puppet accounts.*
- **Wash trade** — a fake trade with no real economics, done to inflate volume or
  price. *Selling your car to yourself repeatedly to fake a "hot market."* The
  reference attacker emits three flavors the cleaning stack is built to catch:
  - **self-deal** — buyer and seller are the *same* address.
  - **wash-cycle / reciprocal funding** — money loops A→B and B→A so net flow is
    ~zero but volume looks real. *Two people passing the same $20 back and forth.*
  - **pure-sybil (ring)** — a tight cluster of fresh fake identities trading only
    with each other. *A room full of sock-puppets clapping for one another.*
- **Louvain community detection** — an algorithm that finds tightly-knit clusters
  in a graph — used to spot sybil rings. *Spotting friend-groups on a social
  network by who talks mostly to whom.*
- **Cluster caps** — no single cluster's volume may count for more than a fixed
  share of the window. *No one voter gets to cast 40% of the ballots.*
- **Robustness diagnostics (flip fraction, LOCO)** — per-rate checks: "can one
  capped cluster even flip this?" and "how much does dropping any one community
  move it?" *A stress test printed on the label.*
- **Manipulation cost bound (attack-cost per bp)** — the least USDC an attacker
  must burn to move the rate by one basis point, computed against a
  cleaning-evading attacker. Prints next to the rate. *"Moving this number 0.01%
  costs you $X" — the bill, on the tag.* (Pillar 3)
- **OU process (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck)** — a "wandering-but-pulled-back-to-normal"
  random process the simulator uses for the true price. *A dog on an elastic
  leash: it drifts but keeps getting tugged back.*

## Crypto / Circle / Arc

- **Arc** — Circle's blockchain built for payments, where **USDC itself is the
  gas** (fee) token. *A toll road where you pay tolls in the same dollars you're
  already carrying.*
- **chain id 5042002 / CAIP-2 (`eip155:5042002`)** — the network's numeric
  address; CAIP-2 is a standard way to name a chain. *A phone country code, but
  for blockchains.*
- **testnet** — a practice copy of a blockchain using fake-value tokens, for
  building safely before going live. *A flight simulator before the real plane.*
- **USDC** — Circle's regulated dollar stablecoin (1 USDC ≈ $1). On Arc it's a
  *native system contract* at `0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000` and is
  itself the gas token. *A digital dollar bill that also pays its own postage.*
- **Malachite** — Arc's consensus engine (the software that lets all the
  computers agree on order). *The referee crew that decides what officially
  happened.*
- **finality / Malachite finality / no reorgs** — once Arc confirms a
  transaction it is **permanent within a second and never reversed** ("reorg" =
  the chain rewriting recent history, which can't happen here). This is why the
  tape's timestamps are trustworthy enough to do the math on. *The whistle blows,
  the goal counts, and no replay can take it back.*
- **Circle Gateway** — Circle's rail that pools and settles USDC across chains.
  *The clearing house all the payments flow through.*
- **Agent Marketplace** — Circle's directory where AI agents discover and pay for
  services (ACR lists itself there). *An app store for machine-to-machine
  services.*
- **SLO (service-level objective)** — a promised performance level, e.g. "99% of
  responses under 250 ms" — one of the quality features ACR adjusts for. *The
  "delivered in 30 min or it's free" promise.*
- **x402** — the HTTP "402 Payment Required" standard: pay per API call. *A
  turnstile that takes a coin before it lets you through.*
- **Nanopayments** — sub-cent payments (fractions of a cent per call). *Dropping
  a tenth of a penny in the meter each time.*
- **EIP-3009 ("transfer with authorization")** — pay by signing a message, no
  separate approval transaction. *Signing a check instead of moving cash twice.*
- **EIP-712** — the standard for signing structured, human-readable data so a
  contract can verify who signed. *A notarized form with a verifiable signature.*
- **Oracle** — an on-chain contract that publishes off-chain facts (here, the
  rate) for other contracts to read. *The stadium scoreboard everyone trusts.*
- **Attestation / AttestationRegistry** — a signed statement of a seller's
  metadata (model class, latency), stored on-chain to feed the quality
  adjustment. *A verified badge on a seller's profile.*
- **x402 Facilitator (Dev / Circle)** — the service that verifies and settles an
  x402 payment (`/verify` + `/settle`). "Dev" is a local mock; "Circle" is the
  real Nanopayments one. *The payment terminal that approves the card.*
- **Signer (Local / Circle wallet) / custody** — who holds the key and signs the
  rate. Local = a raw dev key; Circle wallet = a managed (custodial) key. *Your
  own house key vs a key the bank holds in a vault for you.*
- **Foundry / invariant tests / `fail_on_revert`** — the Solidity toolkit and its
  tests; *invariants* are rules that must ALWAYS hold no matter what. *"The scores
  can never go negative" — checked against every possible play.*
- **Gas / gasless** — the fee to run a transaction. On Arc it's paid in USDC, so
  users never need a separate coin. *Paying the postage in the same currency as
  the goods.*

## On-chain & payments mechanics

- **`.sol`** — a Solidity source file, i.e. a smart contract's code (`ACROracle.sol`,
  `AttestationRegistry.sol`). *The recipe card for an on-chain vending machine.*
- **`postPrint`** — the oracle function that publishes a new rate on-chain. *Pinning
  today's number to the public board.*
- **relayer** — whoever *submits* the signed rate transaction; because the contract
  checks the *signature*, the submitter needn't be the signer. *A courier can drop
  off a sealed, signed envelope — the seal is what's trusted, not the courier.*
- **signature verification (verifies the signer)** — the contract recovers who
  signed and checks it's authorized, instead of trusting who sent it. *The bank
  checks the signature on the check, not who walked it in.*
- **MAX_TS_SKEW** — a guardrail: a rate whose timestamp is too far in the *future*
  is rejected, so a fat-fingered date can't jam the feed. *Refusing a check
  post-dated to the year 3000.*
- **isStale / staleness / latestPrintWithAge** — a way for readers to ask "how old
  is this rate?" and refuse to settle on a stale one. *Checking the milk's
  best-by date before you drink it.*
- **monotone timestamps** — each new rate must be strictly newer than the last.
  *Page numbers that only ever go up.*
- **pause / setPaused** — an emergency stop that halts new posts. *The big red
  "stop the line" button.*
- **2-step ownership (transfer)** — handing over admin control needs the new owner
  to *accept*, so you can't send it to a wrong/dead address. *A certified letter
  that only counts once the recipient signs for it.*
- **nonce** — a per-seller counter included in a signed message so an old signature
  can't be reused. *A one-time code that expires the moment it's used.*
- **deadline** — an expiry timestamp on a signed message. *A coupon with a "use by"
  date.*
- **replay / replay-proof** — "replay" = re-submitting an old signed message to
  cheat; the nonce + deadline make that impossible. *A movie ticket that can't be
  scanned twice.*

## Services & interfaces (the code that runs it)

- **TapeSource / SimSource / ArcSource** — one common "data-in" interface with two
  implementations: `SimSource` (the simulator) and `ArcSource` (real Arc testnet).
  The estimator doesn't care which. *One faucet handle; the water can come from
  the tank or the mains.*
- **offline-tolerant** — if no chain/credentials are configured, the code quietly
  falls back to the simulator instead of crashing. *A GPS that still shows the map
  when it loses signal.*
- **FastAPI** — the Python web framework serving the index API. *The waiter that
  takes requests and brings back data.*
- **lifespan** — a startup/shutdown hook; here it launches the background refresh +
  poster loop when the API boots. *Flipping the "open" sign and starting the
  coffee machine when the shop opens.*
- **poster loop** — a background job that re-estimates and posts a fresh rate on a
  schedule (hourly). *The clock tower that chimes every hour on its own.*
- **x402-gated** — an endpoint that returns "402 Payment Required" until you pay.
  *A paywall on an article.*
- **`/verify` + `/settle`** — the facilitator's two steps: check the payment is
  valid, then actually move the USDC. *Authorize the card, then charge it.*
- **`/onchain` (reader)** — an API endpoint that returns the rate *read straight
  from the blockchain* (not the freshly computed one). *Reading the number off the
  official public board, not your own notes.*
- **DevFacilitator / CircleFacilitator** — the mock (local, for testing) vs the
  real (Circle Nanopayments) payment verifier. *A toy cash register vs the real
  card terminal.*
- **LocalKeySigner / CircleWalletSigner / `build_signer`** — sign with a raw local
  key (dev) or a Circle-managed custodial wallet (prod); `build_signer` picks the
  right one from config. *Sign with your own pen, or have the bank's vault sign
  for you.*
- **PAYMENT-REQUIRED / PAYMENT-SIGNATURE / PAYMENT-RESPONSE** — the three x402 HTTP
  headers: the server's price challenge, the client's signed payment, and the
  server's receipt. *"That'll be $2" → you tap the card → here's your receipt.*
- **fail-closed** — if a payment can't be verified, deny access (the *safe*
  default). *A door that locks itself when the power's out, not swings open.*
- **SSR (server-side rendering)** — the web page is built on the server and sent
  ready-to-read, so it loads fast and works without heavy client JavaScript. *A
  meal delivered plated, not as raw ingredients to cook yourself.*
- **settlement-grade** — trustworthy and well-guarded enough that other contracts
  can safely settle money against it. *"Bank-grade," but for a published number.*
- **manipulation-resistant** — built so fakes and attackers can barely move it.
  *A scale you can't fool by leaning on it.*
- **benchmark-native (institution)** — a firm whose core business is rates/indices
  (ICE, Apollo, BNY, Mastercard) — the natural customers/judges for ACR. *People
  who run scoreboards for a living.*
- **ICE / IBA (ICE Benchmark Administration)** — the company that officially
  administers LIBOR; it's on Arc's testnet roster, i.e. a realistic ACR adopter.
  *The org that keeps the "official interest rate" — a perfect customer.*
- **ABC (abstract base class)** — a code "interface" that lists methods every
  implementation must provide (e.g. `TapeSource`). *A job description every hire
  must fulfil.*
- **reprice** — recompute each trade's price at a reference quality (what the
  hedonic step does). *Re-quoting every sale as if it were the standard model.*
- **red-team** — deliberately attacking your own system to prove it holds up.
  *Hiring burglars to test your own locks.*
- **paper-traded** — simulated trading with no real money at risk (an acceptable
  cut for the future). *Playing poker with matchsticks.*
- **deflator** — a hidden factor that quietly shrinks a measured value — e.g. a
  volatile gas token baked into a price; ACR dodges it by pricing purely in USDC.
  *Measuring height with a ruler that keeps shrinking.*
- **conftest / hermetic tests** — `conftest.py` wires up the test suite; *hermetic*
  means tests run sealed off from any local config, so they give the same result
  everywhere. *A cleanroom: same inputs, same output, every time.*
- **CI (continuous integration)** — automation that runs the tests/gates on every
  change. (Note: "CI" also means *confidence interval* elsewhere — context tells
  which.) *A robot that re-checks your homework each time you edit it.*

## Agentic economy & Circle live-wiring (the demand side)

- **agentic economy** — a market where the buyers and sellers are software agents,
  not people. *A bazaar where the shoppers are robots.*
- **buyer agent** — a program that autonomously finds services and pays for them
  (`apps/agent`, TypeScript, using **viem** — a TS Ethereum library). *A robot
  shopper with its own wallet.*
- **DevPayer / GatewayPayer** — the agent's two payment modes: a local mock vs the
  real Circle path. *A pretend till vs a real card machine.*
- **GatewayClient / `@circle-fin/x402-batching`** — Circle's client library the
  agent uses to make batched x402 payments. *The pay-app on the robot's phone.*
- **GatewayWallet / GatewayWalletBatched** — the Circle smart contract that holds
  pooled USDC and that x402 payments are signed *against* (EIP-712 domain name
  `GatewayWalletBatched`; testnet address `0x0077777d7EBA4688BDeF3E311b846F25870A19B9`).
  *The shared prepaid account the turnstile debits.*
- **facilitator endpoint** — the real Circle host `gateway-api-testnet.circle.com`
  with `POST /v1/x402/verify` and `/v1/x402/settle`; scheme `exact`. *The card
  network's authorize-then-charge API.*
- **scheme `exact`** — the x402 payment scheme that pays an exact amount via
  EIP-3009. *Paying the precise sticker price, no haggling.*
- **Agent Marketplace endpoints** — `/marketplace/catalog` (the **catalog** of
  payable services) and `/marketplace/receipts` (a **ledger** of paid queries).
  *A menu, and the till roll of everything sold.*
- **Bazaar / Bazaar-shaped** — the format of Circle's Agent Bazaar (its
  marketplace for agent-payable services); our catalog is shaped to match it so
  agents can discover ACR the standard way. *Listing on the same shelf format the
  big store uses.*
- **x402Version 2 (`resource` + `accepts`)** — the version and JSON shape of the
  402 challenge body that buyer SDKs parse: what resource you're buying and which
  payment methods it `accepts`. *The vending machine's little screen saying what
  it sells and which cards it takes.*
- **payable service / listing** — an endpoint an agent can pay to call. *A
  vending-machine slot with a price on it.*
- **floor buyer** — an in-app demo agent (`/demo/buyer/*`) that keeps buying to
  show the loop live. *A house shill who keeps feeding the machine.*
- **webhook (`/webhooks/circle`)** — an HTTP callback Circle sends the API the
  moment a settlement lands. *The bank texting you the instant a payment clears.*
- **Circle Smart Contract Platform (SCP) / Gas Station** — Circle's API to deploy
  and manage contracts, with gas sponsored so deploys are gasless
  (`deploy_circle.py`, with `setSigner` to authorize the poster, or
  `--import-by-address` to register an already-deployed one). *A concierge that
  installs your vending machine and pays the install fee.*
- **Developer-Controlled Wallet / `circle-developer-controlled-wallets` (SDK)** —
  a wallet whose keys Circle custodies for your app; an **SDK** is just a code
  library. *A company card the bank holds and swipes on your say-so.*
- **`attestWithSig` (meta-attestation)** — a seller EIP-712-signs their attestation
  (with a nonce + deadline) and a **relayer** submits it and pays the gas, so one
  funded account can register many sellers. *Mailing in a signed form someone else
  files for you.*
- **interop / conformance check** — the agent's self-test (`interop.ts`) that our
  402 challenge parses exactly the way Circle's client expects. *A dry-run to make
  sure our plug fits their socket.*
- **Paymaster / ERC-4337** — an "account-abstraction" way to have someone else
  sponsor gas; ACR **doesn't need it** because on Arc, USDC *is* the gas. *A
  gift-card for tolls you don't need when tolls are already free.*
- **The Fixing / Arc Dawn** — the Terminal's editorial framing (the hourly rate
  "fixing") and its visual theme (a pre-dawn navy→gold sunrise). *The newspaper's
  masthead and its front-page look.*
- **ChainFactsStrip / OracleProvenance / FinalityBadge / SettlementTape /
  WebhookActivity** — Terminal panels that show, respectively: the chain facts,
  the `postPrint` transaction + block (**provenance**), the print's age/staleness,
  a live feed of settlements, and recent webhook events. *The dashboard lights
  that prove the number is real, fresh, and paid-for.*
- **SWR** — a React library that automatically re-fetches data every few seconds
  so the Terminal stays live. *An auto-refreshing scoreboard.*

## On-chain futures & the Public Desk (Pillar 4, live)

- **ACRFutures.sol** — the on-chain venue: a weekly **cash-settled** future per index
  that resolves against the oracle. *A betting window at the stadium that pays out
  against the official scoreboard.*
- **series** — one tradeable contract line (an index + expiry + multiplier + a
  designated maker). *One specific "Team A to win, by Friday" market.*
- **multiplier** — USDC paid per 1.0 of index value per contract (e.g. 1000). *How
  many dollars each "point" is worth.*
- **designated maker / mirror side** — one appointed counterparty takes the exact
  opposite of every taker's fill, so the book's net position is always zero
  (**open interest = 0**). *The house automatically takes the other side of your
  bet.*
- **open interest (OI)** — the total size of open positions; here it nets to zero
  because the maker mirrors everyone. *How much money is riding on the table.*
- **initial margin (`MARGIN_BPS` — 2000 bp / 20% on the current deployment; it is an immutable constructor argument, so read it from the venue rather than assuming it)** — collateral you must post to hold a
  position; trades/withdrawals revert below it. *The deposit you leave to hold
  the bet.* (Initial-margin only — no intraday liquidation, a documented testnet
  simplification.)
- **mark-to-oracle** — positions are valued at the live oracle price. *Your bet's
  worth, updated to the current score.*
- **collateral / `post_collateral` / withdrawable** — the USDC you lock to trade,
  and what you're allowed to take back out. *Chips you buy in with, and what you
  can cash out.*
- **`Traded` event / trade tape / fill** — every executed trade emits a `Traded`
  log; the Terminal streams these as the live tape. *The ticker of trades
  scrolling by.*
- **socialized-loss settlement** — at expiry (via `latestPrintWithAge`, rejecting
  a mark older than `MAX_SETTLE_AGE` = 7200s), losers are floored to zero and any
  shortfall haircuts the winners pro-rata, so the contract never pays out more
  USDC than it holds (**solvency**, no minting). *If a loser can't cover, the pot
  is shared out fairly rather than promising money that isn't there.*
- **`FuturesClient` / `FuturesReader`** — the Python client that reads/writes the
  venue, and the API-side cached reader that serves the desk, maker inventory, and
  trade tape to the Terminal. *The cashier who reads the board and takes orders.*
- **maker inventory** — the maker's current net position; read back on-chain and
  used to **skew the term-structure curve** (a long book pulls the curve down).
  *Which way the house is leaning, which tilts its quotes.*
- **`futures_loop.py` / `futures_seed.py`** — the maker bot that seeds and keeps
  the on-chain book moving. *The market-stall owner who keeps restocking so
  there's always something to trade.*
- **Public Desk** — the feature that lets an ordinary reader take a **real**
  ACRFutures position from the Terminal. *A "place your bet" button for the public.*
- **user-controlled wallet / SCA** — a smart-contract account whose keys the *user*
  holds (PIN/passkey), not the server; contrast the developer-controlled (custody)
  wallet and the Circle agent wallet. **Four wallet types**: user-controlled (the
  desk reader) · developer-controlled (the press, the treasury, and every
  unattended venue job) · Circle agent wallet (the autonomous hedger, which pays
  x402 through the CLI and so needs no exported key) · a one-time offline deploy
  key. Which one a role gets is forced by a constraint, never chosen for taste —
  `ecrecover` demands an EOA account type, a cron job cannot hold an expiring
  email-OTP session, and a reader's key must never reach our server. The full map
  and its reasoning: [`docs/WALLETS.md`](WALLETS.md). *Your own safe vs the bank's
  vault vs the shop's float.*
- **PIN ceremony / passkey / `@circle-fin/w3s-pw-web-sdk`** — the browser flow where
  the user's PIN authorizes each on-chain action; the server never sees the key.
  *Tapping your own PIN at the terminal — the shop never learns it.*
- **challenge-response / challengeId** — the server mints a signed "challenge" the
  browser SDK executes under the user's PIN. *A one-time authorization slip you
  personally sign.*
- **faucet drip** — a small, one-per-wallet USDC stake handed out (from custody) so
  a new desk user can trade. *A free starter chip to get you playing.*
- **`PublicDesk` / `FuturesDesk` / `FuturesTape` / `QuoteCorridor`** — Terminal
  panels: the take-a-position widget, the maker's book, the live fill tape, and the
  bid/ask corridor chart. *The betting slip, the odds board, the ticker, and the
  price chart.*
- **`make deck` / marp** — renders the submission slides (`docs/presentation.md` →
  `.html`/`.pdf`) with the marp tool. *The "export to slides" button.*

## Live deployment & operations

- **LIVE on Arc testnet** — ACR is not just buildable, it's **running in production**
  on Arc's test network (chain 5042002). *The shop is open, not just built.*
- **Vercel** — the host serving the Terminal (`arc-compute-rate.vercel.app`). *The
  landlord for the storefront website.*
- **Render** — the host serving the seller API (`acr-api-1fto.onrender.com`), which
  posts a Circle-signed oracle price every hour. *The landlord for the back office.*
- **arcscan (`testnet.arcscan.app`)** — Arc's block explorer, where anyone can look
  up a contract or transaction. *The public land registry for the chain.*
- **the deployed contracts** — the live addresses on Arc: **ACROracle
  `0x4f00…2609`**, **AttestationRegistry `0x23ae…dFb7`**, **ACRFutures
  `0x29d9…42fe`** (self-rolling; series 3 in the latest bundle), and
  **FeedAccessAttestor `0xe671…FD47`**. *The shops' street addresses.*
- **Circle Gateway receipts / batch UUID** — every real x402 payment produces a
  durable receipt carrying Circle's Gateway batch identifier, saved in-repo. *The
  stamped, filed copy of each sale.*
- **P-256 / ECDSA signature (webhooks)** — Circle signs its webhook callbacks with a
  P-256 (an elliptic-curve, ECDSA) key; the API verifies that signature before
  trusting the event. *Checking the wax seal on a letter before you act on it.*
- **heartbeat cron / `futures-heartbeat.yml` / `futures-lifecycle.yml`** — scheduled
  GitHub Actions that keep the futures book alive 24/7 — the heartbeat
  self-provisions collateral and trades; the lifecycle rolls and settles series.
  *An automatic caretaker who keeps the lights on and the shelves stocked.*
- **keepalive (cron)** — a scheduled ping that stops the free-tier host from
  sleeping. *Nudging the shop so it doesn't nap between customers.*
- **"cron fires only from the default branch"** — a GitHub gotcha: scheduled
  workflows run only from `main`, so automation is armed only once merged. *The
  timer only counts down once the plan is filed at head office.*
- **rate limiter / per-identity (`ratelimit.py`, `DESK_BUDGETS`)** — desk request
  budgets keyed on the user's wallet/id, not the shared proxy IP (which collapses
  every visitor into one bucket behind a server-side proxy). *Giving each customer
  their own tab instead of one shared tab for the whole street.*
- **attested-market decode (`ACR_ARC_ATTESTED_ONLY`)** — a live-tape mode where the
  on-chain transfer *amount is the price signal* (one settlement = a published
  quantity) and events from non-attested sellers are dropped — attestation earns
  index inclusion (the registry flywheel, made literal). *Only listed vendors count,
  and each sale's total tells you the unit price.*
- **CI jobs (python · contracts · agent · terminal)** — the four independent
  GitHub-CI checks that must pass on every push. *Four inspectors who each sign off
  before anything ships.*

## Autonomous agents & the self-owning venue

- **autonomous hedger (`scripts/hedger.py`, `GET /hedger`)** — a single agent that
  runs a four-step loop: pay a real x402 nanopayment for the latest `ACR-INF` print,
  read its own on-chain ACRFutures position, compute the gap to its mandate, and
  trade that difference. It is the demand side made whole — an agent that *reads the
  rate, then trades on what it read*. *A trader who buys today's price sheet, checks
  what it already owns, and places one order to hit its target.*
- **mandate / `TARGET`** — the position the hedger is told to hold (in contracts);
  `gap = TARGET − position` drives each trade. *The instruction: "stay this long."*
- **agent wallet** — a Circle wallet an agent signs through (email/OTP), with **no
  exportable private key**; the hedger signs every payment and trade this way. *A
  company card the agent can spend with but can never photocopy.*
- **`feasible_qty`** — the shared sizing helper (from `index_api.desk`) that clamps a
  desired trade to what margin and book room actually allow. *Checking your wallet and
  the shelf before deciding how much to buy.*
- **venue keeper (`services/index_api/index_api/keeper.py`)** — the in-process loop
  (runs beside the press) that keeps the futures venue trading and rolls it across
  expiries. *The caretaker who both works the counter and opens tomorrow's stall.*
- **self-rolling venue / `roll_if_needed` / `openSeries` / `onlyOwner`** — because
  ACRFutures ownership was migrated to the maker's own Circle wallet, and `openSeries`
  is `onlyOwner`, the keeper can open the successor series unattended — the venue
  *owns itself*. *The shop holds its own keys, so it can unlock itself each morning.*
- **`migrate_venue_owner.py` / `pendingOwner` / `acceptOwnership`** — the one-time tool
  that handed venue ownership from the retiring deploy EOA to the maker wallet using
  the safe **two-step** transfer (propose, then accept). *Signing the deed over to the
  new owner, who must counter-sign to take it.*
- **"shape read from the chain" (`live_indices`)** — the keeper derives the tradable
  roster from `read_all_series()` (unsettled, unexpired) and reads the mark on-chain,
  instead of trusting a configured constant. *Reading today's board off the wall, not
  last week's memo.*
- **`build_role_signer` / role signer** — the router that maps each job
  (**maker · taker · poster · owner**) to *its own* Circle Developer-Controlled wallet,
  deliberately **ignoring the ambient `.env` key**. *Every role carries its own badge;
  none can borrow the master key.*
- **FeedAccessAttestor (`contracts/src/FeedAccessAttestor.sol`, `0xe671…FD47`)** — a
  fifth on-chain contract. The seller signs an EIP-712 **`FeedAccess`** struct
  (`payer`, `beneficiary`, `paidUntil`, `amountUsdc`, `nonce`) with the same poster
  Circle wallet that signs oracle prints; anyone relays **`redeem(...)`**, which
  `ecrecover`s the authorized signer and records `paidUntil[beneficiary]`, so
  **`hasFeedAccess(addr)`** becomes an on-chain fact. The seller *signs, it does not
  decide* — it can only attest wallets that actually paid (appear in
  `/marketplace/receipts` with `scheme == "exact"`). *A turnstile that opens for
  anyone holding a receipt the shop already signed.*
- **`MAX_ACCESS_WINDOW` (90 days)** — the contract's cap on how far any single grant
  may reach, so a signer compromise costs weeks, not a century (the live grant was
  re-minted from 7 → 60 days, inside the cap). *A gift card that can never be dated
  more than three months out.*
- **`attest_feed_access.py` / `DeployAttestor.s.sol`** — the script that reads the
  public receipts ledger and signs the grant, and the Foundry deploy for the contract.
- **durable receipts (`services/index_api/index_api/receipts_live.jsonl`, `_rehydrate`)**
  — the settlement ledger was moved out of gitignored/dockerignored `data/` into
  `services/…` so it ships **inside the image** and `/revenue` + `/marketplace/receipts`
  survive a restart; `revenue_usdc` now rounds to 6 dp (no float noise). *Keeping the
  sales book in the safe that moves with the shop, not on a desk that gets cleared.*
- **x402 live buyer / `GatewayPayer` (`apps/agent`, `x402-buy.yml`)** — the TypeScript
  buyer that runs **real** settlements against the live seller through Circle's Gateway
  (402 → sign EIP-3009 → settle), archiving each `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` receipt. *A real
  customer who actually pays at the till, not a demo shopper.*
- **wallets by role** — the live keys, each doing one job: **poster/press `0x8366…`**,
  **venue owner + maker `0x9D44…`**, **heartbeat taker `0xc972…`**, **readers** on
  their own **user-controlled** wallets, the **autonomous hedger** on a Circle **agent
  wallet**, and the **retired deploy EOA `0x3318…`**, which now holds **no authority**.
  *One badge per role, and the old master badge deactivated.*

## Instrument (Pillar 4)

- **Future (cash-settled)** — a contract to settle the *difference* vs the index
  at a future date — no goods change hands. *Betting on next month's gas price
  and just paying/collecting the difference, never taking delivery of fuel.*
- **Market maker** — someone who always posts a price to buy and a price to sell,
  creating liquidity. *The currency-exchange booth quoting both directions.*
- **Avellaneda–Stoikov** — a well-known recipe for setting those buy/sell quotes
  based on inventory and risk. *A rulebook for how wide to set the spread and
  when to lean.*

## The pipeline in plain words (flow ①→⑩)

1. **Exhaust** — machines pay each other; each payment (price, size, who, when)
   streams in.
2. **Batched tape** — those payments settle in delayed batches, which smears the
   timing (the "convolution").
3. **Deconvolve** — the Kalman filter un-smears the batching to recover what the
   price actually was moment to moment (Pillar 1).
4. **Clean** — throw out the fakes: self-trades, wash rings, and sybil clusters
   (funding-graph + Louvain).
5. **Robust estimate** — take the trimmed, size-weighted *middle* of what's left,
   so no whale or fake can drag it; attach an error range (CI).
6. **Hedonic** — adjust for quality so a frontier model and a cheap one are
   compared fairly → the constant-quality rate (Pillar 2).
7. **Print + bound** — publish the hourly rate **and** the dollar cost to move it
   1bp (Pillar 3).
8. **Oracle** — sign the rate and post it on-chain to `ACROracle` for other
   contracts to read.
9. **Settle** — the weekly future cash-settles against that on-chain rate.
10. **Agents pay for the rate** — machines pay a fraction of a cent (x402) to read
    the index. The index about machine commerce is bought *by* machines — the
    loop closes.
