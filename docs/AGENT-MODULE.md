# Module A — the agent card, and a quota denominated in people

*Measured on `feat/agent-card-gateway`, 2026-09-13: 691 pytest (0 skipped),
ruff clean, `verify_claims.py` green, CI 6/6 (run `34692572389`); deployed as `main`.*

Companion to `WORLD-MODULE.md`. That document designs the human layer; this one spends it.
Module A is three things that compose: a **screen** on agent-to-agent traffic, a signed **card**
that says which agent is calling, and a **rate limit that counts humans rather than keys**.

Read the two limits first. Both are deliberate, and both are the kind of thing a reader will
otherwise discover by being surprised.

> **The carded tier is evadable, by design.** Anyone can mint a card — that is what
> permissionless means — so a per-card limit is a per-key limit, and keys are free. An agent that
> wants more than its budget mints a second key and gets a second budget. The card buys
> *attribution*, not scarcity. Only the human tier is scarce, and claiming a human is optional.

> **A human-bound card stops verifying when the window rolls.** Cluster ids are
> `keccak(nullifier, salt, window)`, so the same person's id changes completely every 7 days.
> Current window **2958**; the next roll is **2026-09-17 00:00:00 UTC**. A card minted before a
> roll and presented after it is refused — correctly — and the gate says *re-mint*, not *your
> claim is false*.

## 0 · The hole this closed, and it was measurable

Before this module — at `17ae570`, the commit this branch starts from — every rate-limit call
site in `app.py` passed an identity except one:

```
app.py:889   ratelimit.check(request, "graph")                          # no ident
app.py:946   ratelimit.check(request, "humanid", session_ident(...))
app.py:1398  ratelimit.check(request, "limits", req.address)
```

It now reads, at `app.py:909` — the line moved down by exactly the 20 net lines this module
inserted above it:

```
ratelimit.check(request, "graph", agent.ident if agent else None)
```

`ratelimit.py` explains at length why that matters: readers arrive through one Vercel proxy, so
the host bucket is a **global** limit wearing a per-person costume. `DESK_BUDGETS["graph"] =
(300, 3600)` was therefore unreachable code — the per-caller budget for the endpoint that spends
our Studio quota did not exist. It needed no new budget key. It needed an identity to key on.

**And an identity that costs nothing does not fix a quota, it renames the problem.** That is why
the card can claim a human cluster and the gate verifies the claim on chain: the limit then keys
on the person. Three wallets belonging to one human land in one bucket; a wallet belonging to
someone else lands in another. Asserted in a test, and demonstrated against Arc — possible only
because `HumanIdMirror` went live the day before.

## 1 · The card — the domain names no contract, and that is the point

`packages/acr_oracle_client/acr_oracle_client/agentcard.py` (297 lines). EIP-712, domain
`("ACR Agent Card", "1")` — the free slot in an idiom four domains already follow (`ACR Oracle`,
`ACR AttestationRegistry`, `ACR Receipt Mirror`, `ACR Human Id Mirror`).

```
AgentCard(
  address agent,         // the signing key — this IS the agent id
  string  name,
  string  role,          // maker | taker | poster | owner | reader
  string  audience,      // the service this card is FOR
  bytes32 scopeHash,     // keccak of the sorted, de-duplicated scope list
  bytes32 humanCluster,  // CLAIMED cluster; 0x0 = no claim
  uint64  issuedAt,
  uint64  expiresAt
)
```

`role` reuses the venue's own `_ROLE_WALLET_FIELDS` vocabulary (`signer.py:248`) plus `reader`, so
the card's roles and the service accounts are one taxonomy rather than two.

### What the missing `verifyingContract` costs

The four existing domains each bind to a deployed address, because a contract verifies them. A
card is verified by whoever reads it, so there is no address to name — and a bare
`{name, version, chainId}` domain is valid at **any** verifier on that chain. Two costs, both paid
inside the struct:

- **Replay at another service.** Paid by `audience`: a card addressed elsewhere is refused here.
  This is what stands in for `verifyingContract`.
- **Replay at this service, inside the window.** A bearer credential is replayable until it
  expires, so `MAX_TTL_S = 900` bounds it — enforced at the signer *and* at the gate, because a
  hostile agent does not call our `mint()`. `CLOCK_SKEW_S = 30` absorbs honest clock drift.

A nonce per call would be stronger and is the wrong trade: an agent cannot afford a round trip
before every request. Freshness is carried inside the signed message instead, which is the same
choice the AgentKit verifier makes.

**There is no `ACR_AGENT_MAX_TTL_S`.** The bound is a constant, not a setting, deliberately: the
only direction anyone ever moves a TTL ceiling is *longer*, and a configurable replay window is a
footgun whose blast radius is every card ever signed.

## 2 · The gate — five refusals, in order

`services/index_api/index_api/agentgate.py` (378 lines). A FastAPI `Depends` mirroring
`require_payment` (`x402.py:613`) and `require_human` (`humanid.py:594`), setting
`request.state.agent` beside `.payment` and `.human`.

1. **The signature recovers to `agent`** — else 401. Everything else in the card is a claim *by*
   that key, so this is the only check whose failure means "you are not who you say".
2. **`audience` is ours** — else 401.
3. **`role` is known** — else 401.
4. **The window, and the bound on it** — expired, not-yet-valid, inverted, or longer than
   `MAX_TTL_S`: 401.
5. **The human claim, if one was made** — `clusterOf(agent, current_window())` on Arc must equal
   `humanCluster`. A mismatch is a **refusal, not a downgrade**: a card claiming a human it cannot
   prove is worse than one claiming none.

`cluster_of` (`humanid.py:284`) already existed and the service had never read it. The gate is its
first consumer.

### The third state — "we could not check"

An unconfigured or unreachable mirror is neither a valid claim nor a false one. The gate declines
the human tier, says which of the two happened, and **never upgrades on the strength of a claim
nobody verified**. `/agent/info` reports `human_binding_verifiable` for exactly this reason: a
gate that cannot check claims and a gate handing out the tier freely look identical from outside.

One wrinkle, found by running the demo rather than by reading the code.
`HumanIdMirrorClient.configured()` requires a signer as well as an address, because that class
both reads and writes — and every *view* on it, `cluster_of` included, gated on `configured()`.
So with no write key present `cluster_of` returned `None`, and `None` there means "this wallet
belongs to no human": a missing credential was indistinguishable from an unresolved wallet, and a
read-only deployment would have reported nobody as verified while every call succeeded. The gate
now asks `readable()` — an address is enough for a view — and so do the three view methods;
`isSigner` and `record` keep `configured()` because they genuinely need the key. The human tier is
reachable on a deployment that holds no mirror-writing key, which is the deployment that should
have it.

## 3 · Three tiers, and only one of them is scarce

```
anonymous   no card              -> the host ceiling, which is global behind a proxy
carded      a signed card        -> per-KEY, and keys are free (see the warning above)
human       a confirmed cluster  -> per-PERSON, and people are not free
```

`/graph/query` takes an **optional** card: with one, the rate-limit ident is the cluster when
human-bound and the agent address otherwise. Optional because breaking the public tape read is
not a trade worth making for a tighter quota.

**And a verified identity is excused the host ceiling, which is what makes the tiers real.**
`ratelimit.check` applies the host bucket *as well as* the per-identity one, so for a day a card
bought a second constraint rather than an escape from the shared one: the carded caller still
queued behind every stranger on the same proxy address. That is backwards. Passing
`verified=True` now returns once a cryptographically proved identity has passed its own budget —
and *only* a
proved one. A desk address out of a request body or a session token must never set it, because
those are rotatable, and the ceiling would then be free to evade.

Ten agent-facing routes carry an optional card now rather than one. Nine of them are reads that
were previously unmetered, and they stay unmetered **for anonymous callers** — measured, not
assumed: `/api/tape` refreshes every 30 seconds and fans out one `/rating/{seller}` call per
seller, so a single reader drives on the order of a thousand upstream calls an hour through one
proxy address. Any host ceiling worth picking would stop the desk before it stopped an abuser.
The limiter therefore runs where there is an identity to limit, which is also the honest form of
the argument: the card is what creates the identity.

## 4 · The screen, where it applies, and why it fails closed

`services/index_api/index_api/armor.py`. Google Cloud Model Armor over its REST surface, both
directions — `:sanitizeUserPrompt` and `:sanitizeModelResponse`.

**It applies to `POST /graph/query`, for carded callers, in both directions.** That sentence is
the whole of section 4 and it was absent for a day: the module shipped with **zero production call
sites**, so `/armor/info` would have reported `screened: 0` forever while three places in `app.py`
asserted a screen "sitting on agent-to-agent traffic". The module was the easy half. A screen
nobody calls is the same defect as an unreachable rate-limit budget, which is what Module A was
built to fix — committed twice, one layer apart.

Two scoping decisions, both deliberate:

- **Carded callers only.** `armor.py` screens *agent-to-agent* traffic, and a browser reader
  arriving through the Vercel proxy is not that. Roughly a thousand of those reach `/graph/query`
  every hour, so screening them would mean one expired service-account key turns the public tape
  into a blank page — with `/armor/info` correctly reporting that the screen did its job. So the
  card buys two things rather than one: **a bucket of your own, and a screened reply.**
- **After the limiter, not before.** A screen in front of an unmetered caller is a new amplifier.
  A caller sending injections should spend budget doing it.

Text is capped — 4 096 characters on a request, 16 384 on a reply — and `/armor/info` publishes
both numbers, because a payload past the cap is **not inspected** and a reader should not have to
assume otherwise.

It fails **closed** on timeout, error body, unparseable shape, and unrecognised
`filterMatchState`. The last one is the interesting case: an unparsed response is precisely where
admitting traffic is worst, because it is the state an attacker can most plausibly induce.

Three statuses, because three different people need to look in three different places:

| condition | status | whose problem |
|---|---|---|
| the request was refused | **403** | the caller's own input, understood and declined. `400` would read as "malformed" and send them to rewrite a query that was fine |
| the reply was refused | **502** | nobody's fault but the upstream's. The caller did nothing wrong and we will not relay what came back |
| no verdict reached | **503** | ours. We could not inspect it, so we will not serve it — and it is transient |

Verified against the live `EthOnline_Project` template in `asia-south1`: prompt injection
`MATCH_FOUND` at `LOW_AND_ABOVE`, benign text clean in both directions. `google-auth` is an
optional `armor` extra (mirroring `circle`), so the base image still builds with no GCP
credentials, and `build_screen` falls back to a six-pattern `LocalScreen` floor.

`/armor/info` reports which backend answered and never the template's thresholds — those live in
the template, where an operator can change them without a redeploy, so a copy here would be a
second source of truth that goes stale silently.

## 5 · Configuration

| variable | meaning |
|---|---|
| `ACR_AGENT_AUDIENCE` | the audience this gate accepts (`acr-index-api`) |
| `ACR_ARMOR_MODE` | `auto` \| `local` \| `gcp` \| `off` |
| `ACR_ARMOR_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project |
| `ACR_ARMOR_LOCATION` | **no default** — Model Armor is regional and a wrong region 404s on the template, which reads like "the template does not exist" |
| `ACR_ARMOR_TEMPLATE` | template id |
| `ACR_ARMOR_CREDENTIALS_FILE` | a **path** to a service-account JSON, never the JSON |
| `ACR_ARMOR_TIMEOUT_S` | default 10.0 |
| `ACR_HUMANID_MIRROR_ADDRESS` | the human tier's source of truth; unset, every human claim is declined and `/ops` + the footer say so |
| `ACR_READER_PRIVATE_KEY` | signs the cards OUR callers present (`verify_live`, `demo_agent`); never the poster key, never required |
| `ACR_PRESS_CRITICAL_USDC` | the poster wallet's hard floor (default 1.0); `/ops` funding and `verify_live` FAIL below it |
| `DEMO_AGENT_API` · `DEMO_AGENT_PORT` · `DEMO_AGENT_BOOT_S` · `DEMO_AGENT_TIMEOUT_S` | `scripts/demo_agent.py`: a deployed host to run against, else the first port for its own read-only API, its boot wait, its per-request timeout |

The MCP server reads its own `ACR_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `ACR_AGENT_HUMAN_CLUSTER` / `ACR_API` from the
MCP host's config — `mcp/README.md`. The buyer agent reads `AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `AGENT_HUMAN_CLUSTER`.
`render.yaml` records every production name above (the credentials as a secret **file** path).

**The production image must install the `armor` extra.** `Dockerfile`'s `UV_EXTRAS` carries
`--extra circle --extra armor`; without the second, `google-auth` is absent, `ModelArmorScreen`
cannot mint a bearer token, and `build_screen` falls back to the offline floor — an image
reporting a screen it does not have, which is the exact failure `/armor/info` exists to prevent.
Note `render.yaml` pulls a **prebuilt image**, so this needs a build and a push, not a merge.

**Model Armor is IAM-gated and rejects API keys outright.** There is no key-shaped credential for
it. And `gcloud auth application-default login` mints a *user* credential, which is worthless in a
container — ADC is a development convenience, not a deployment credential.

## 6 · Checking it worked

              services/index_api/tests/test_agentgate.py \

```

**Seeing it in Google's console — and why the chart can read zero while the calls land.**
`uv run python scripts/armor_probe.py` sends the demo's injection and an honest note through
the seller's own `ModelArmorScreen` and prints Google's answer: the regional endpoint
(`modelarmor.asia-south1.rep.googleapis.com`), `invocationResult=SUCCESS`, and the filters that
fired (`pi_and_jailbreak` for the injection, `NO_MATCH_FOUND` for the note). The console's
traffic chart for the Model Armor API draws on the **Cloud Monitoring API**, which is a separate
service; on 2026-09-13 it was not enabled in the project (`monitoring.googleapis.com` and
`serviceusage.googleapis.com` both answered 403 "has not been used in project … or it is
disabled"), so the chart showed nothing while `/armor/info` counted every call. Enable it at
`https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/monitoring.googleapis.com?project=<project>` and
the chart fills from that moment on — not retroactively. Independently of the console,
`/armor/info` now serves `endpoint`, `template_resource`, `last_verdict_at`, `last_latency_ms`
and `last_invocation`, `/ops` prints "google last answered: N min ago", and the `/loop` screen
lab's Model Armor station shows the same, with a link to the project's own metrics page.

End to end against the live chain, not a mock: present a card claiming the demo fleet's cluster
and confirm **human-bound**; present the same card claiming another human's cluster and confirm
**401**; present two wallets of the same human and confirm **one bucket**; present a card for
another audience, and one with a 30-day TTL, and confirm both refused.

## 7 · The rotation trap, found by walking into it

The fleet's cluster was `0xd9e05794…` in window 2957 and `0x5bf3b922…` in 2958 — no
resemblance, because the window is hashed in. My first end-to-end run used the id I had
written down two days earlier, and the gate refused it, correctly.

An agent that caches its cluster id is by far the likeliest mistake here. So a mismatch that
matches the **previous** window is reported as *re-mint the card* rather than *your claim is
false* — the difference between an actionable 401 and a mysterious one
(`agentgate.py:275-291`). The same silent-rotation shape appears in the terminal's human
resolution and is handled there too.

## 8 · What stays unfinished, deliberately

- **Deployed, and Model Armor is live in production** (2026-09-12, `main` = `797e498`, Render
  image `2026-09-12-1617`). `/armor/info` on `acr-api-1fto.onrender.com` reports `backend: gcp`,
  `live: true`, `asia-south1/EthOnline_Project`; the service-account key rides as a Render secret
  file, since `data/` is in `.dockerignore`. `ACR_ARMOR_MODE` is `auto`, not `gcp`: with all four
  variables set it picks Model Armor, and a misconfiguration shows as a *stated* floor on
  `/armor/info` and `/ops` rather than as a 503 on carded reads. `scripts/demo_agent.py` ran all
  ten acts against the deployed host; Google refused the injection by name over the public
  internet. `ACR_ARMOR_MODE=local` plus a redeploy is the rollback.

  ```bash
  curl -s https://acr-api-1fto.onrender.com/armor/info | jq '.backend, .live, .screened'
  ```
- **Human-attributed volume is real, and four settlements are permanently missing.** The four demo
  wallets were funded and settled 48 purchases across all six sellers on 2026-09-12; **44** are on
  the tape stamped `human: true`, and `/rating` reports `human_share` ≈ 0.22 where it read 0.0.
  The other four hit `ReceiptMirror`'s `backdated for payer` guard: the press wallet ran out of
  gas mid-run, later receipts mirrored before earlier ones, and the contract's per-payer
  monotonic rule — the guard that stops a keeper withholding a receipt until the next print moves
  in its favour — refused them. That is the contract working, at the cost of four rows.
- **Malicious-URI and SDP filters are NOT SET** on the template. Malicious URI is the one I would
  enable next: a reply carrying a hostile link is exactly the "replies contain no malicious data"
  requirement, and responsible-AI filters will not catch it.
- **No registry, no revocation.** A card cannot be cancelled before it expires; the 15-minute
  bound *is* the revocation window. A registry would fix that and would also make the scheme
  permissioned, which is the property being bought here.
- **`scopeHash` is signed and enforced against nothing.** It is in the struct, it is in the
  signature, and `AgentGate.verify` has no scope step. Enforcing it needs a per-route scope map,
  which is a design decision rather than a wiring one. `/agent/whoami` therefore reports
  `scope_enforced: false` out loud, so it cannot quietly become a field everyone assumes is
  checked *because* it is signed.
- **Every caller of ours now presents a card, and one of them is Claude.** The MCP server
  (`mcp/src/card.ts`, the same encoder as the buyer agent's) wraps the one `fetch` every tool uses,
  so `query_tape` from an MCP host is a carded call — driven against production over the real stdio
  transport on 2026-09-13, `cards_verified` moved 14 → 17 while it ran. `viem` is pinned to the
  terminal's resolved version and the lockfile was regenerated with npm 10, CI's major, for the
  reason the earlier edition of this bullet gave for not doing it at all.
- **The Terminal's tape polling presents no card, and that is a design choice**: every human
  reader shares that one server-side process, so one card would mean one identity and **one
  rate-limit bucket for every reader at once** — the global-limit-behind-a-proxy problem the card
  exists to fix. The only cards the Terminal sends are the ones `/developers` mints on purpose — a
  visitor's throwaway key signed in their own tab, or the demo human's, minted server-side from a
  public label — one probe each, never a shared identity.
- **The tier is on the receipt.** For a day the six paid routes verified the card and dropped it,
  so "the card reaches where money moved" was true only of a counter. `PaymentReceipt.tier` is now
  stamped at settlement from the gate's verdict, `/marketplace/receipts` carries it, and the
  settlement ticker marks `carded` and `human` rows — absence on older rows means "before the
  gate", which is not "anonymous", so the ticker never marks absence.
- **Circle custody cannot sign cards.** `signer.full_eip712_json` hardcodes a four-field
  `EIP712Domain` including `verifyingContract`, and this domain has three. `sign_card` refuses a
  `CircleWalletSigner` outright rather than producing a signature that would recover to the wrong
  address. Fixing that function is not a card change: it signs every Circle-custody message in the
  system — prints, attestations, both mirrors — and getting the domain derivation subtly wrong
  means the oracle goes quiet with no local error, because a bad signature is a revert on chain.
  It wants its own commit and a live posting run.
