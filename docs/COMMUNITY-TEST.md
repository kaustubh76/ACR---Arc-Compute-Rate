# Test ACR on Arc mainnet

Written for anyone with a browser wallet and a few dollars of USDC on Base, Ethereum, Arbitrum,
OP Mainnet, Polygon, Avalanche or Unichain. Real money, small amounts: a query costs a fraction of
a cent, and nothing here asks for more than the amount you type.

**Terminal:** https://arc-compute-rate.vercel.app · **Chain:** Arc mainnet, id `5042` ·
**Gas:** USDC (there is no other token on Arc; the wallet shows gas in USDC).

## What you are testing

ACR publishes a reference price for AI compute and sells it per query. You are a human buyer.
The five steps below are the whole revenue path; if any of them stops you, that is the bug.

## The five steps

1. **See the rate.** Open the terminal. The dateline chip says **Arc mainnet** (plain edition:
   *real money*), and the fixing has a time. If the chip says *testnet*, you are on the wrong
   deployment.
2. **Connect.** `/exchange` → open any listing → *connect your wallet to buy*. Your wallet asks
   to add **Arc** (chain 5042, RPC `https://rpc.mainnet.arc.io`, explorer `https://explorer.arc.io`)
   and to switch to it. Approve both.
3. **Fund.** Under the listing, a line shows *wallet … USDC · Gateway … USDC* and exactly one
   next action:
   - **No USDC on Arc** → *Bring USDC from Base →* (pick the chain you hold it on, type an
     amount, press). You sign twice on that chain (approve, burn); then wait. Circle attests and
     the USDC is minted to the same address on Arc. Standard CCTP takes up to ~15 minutes;
     the row lists each step with an explorer link.
   - **USDC on Arc, none in Gateway** → *Deposit to Gateway* (plain: *Move it to
     ready-to-spend*). Two signatures on Arc; the balance appears after finality.
4. **Buy.** *buy with your wallet · $0.00…*. Your wallet signs one message (no transaction).
   The listing answers, a toast shows the amount, and a row lands on the tape.
5. **Check the receipt.** `/api/marketplace/receipts` on the terminal lists your purchase, and
   `/api/revenue` moves by the listing's price. **Read the *movement*, not the totals — and that
   applies to BOTH.** The tape you are looking at in this step and the revenue counter beside it are
   the same rehydrated ring, and on the deployed service it still carries 112 settlements from the
   old testnet deployment (`$0.333477`) against a true 3 (`$0.00461`). Your own row is real and will
   appear; the running total it lands on is not. The fix is in the image tagged `2026-09-30`, which
   has not been deployed.

Optional: the **Desk** on `/curve` gives you a Circle wallet (email + PIN, no extension) that can
buy a **feed pass** for a day of reads. Fund it by sending USDC on Arc to the address it shows.
It can also trade the futures venue — but **not yet on mainnet**: the contract is deployed and no
series has been listed on it, so there is nothing to trade against. The desk says so rather than
showing you an empty book.

## What to report

Open an issue with the *Mainnet test* template, or reply in the community thread. Please include:

- the step number where it stopped, and the sentence the page showed (every failure is a
  sentence; if you got a raw code or a blank, that is itself a bug);
- your wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, …) and which chain you bridged from, if you did;
- the transaction hash or explorer link, when there is one;
- whether the plain edition (top-right toggle) made the step clearer or worse.

You do not need to include your address; the receipt is public anyway.

## Known limits, stated up front

- The **house buyer** is off on mainnet: nothing here spends our USDC on your click, so every
  purchase is from your wallet.
- **Bridging is slow** on standard CCTP (minutes, not seconds) and needs gas on the source chain
  in that chain's native token.
- **Gas on Arc is USDC.** Keep a few cents in the wallet itself, not only in Gateway.
- **Your Gateway balance goes down a few minutes after the purchase, not instantly.** Circle
  batches nanopayments; we measured about nine minutes on testnet. The data arrives immediately
  and the receipt is real from the moment it appears, so do not buy twice thinking it failed.
- **The futures venue has no series on mainnet.** It is deployed, nothing is listed on it, and the
  page says so. Not a bug and not something you can test yet.
- **Transaction-cost analysis (`/tca/<your address>`) has only just started.** It is computed
  inside the subgraph at the moment each settlement arrives, so it knows nothing about you until
  you buy — `purchases: 0` for a new address is the truth, not a failure. Only `/compute/<label>`
  purchases get a slippage number; index routes are counted but not benchmarked. The first real
  one (2026-09-28) came back at **-1139.8 bp**, which is what a thin new venue looks like.
- If the dateline says *archived* rather than *live*, the press is between prints; reads still
  work, and a purchase settles against the archived rate.

## What we will never ask for

A seed phrase, a private key, an approval for an unlimited amount, or a signature you did not
initiate from a button on the page. If a prompt asks for any of those, close it and report it.
