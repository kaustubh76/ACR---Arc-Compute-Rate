# Wallets — which Circle product does which job, and why it has to

ACR touches four different Circle wallet products. They are not
interchangeable, and the choice is never a preference: **every role in this
system has a constraint that picks its wallet type for it.** This document
records those constraints, so the next person does not "simplify" the design by
collapsing them into one.

The short version:

| Role | Wallet product | Account type | Who can sign |
|---|---|---|---|
| Oracle press — hourly EIP-712 prints | **Developer-controlled** | EOA | our backend, via API key + entity secret |
| Treasury · desk faucet · x402 `payTo` | **Developer-controlled** | EOA | our backend |
| Venue maker | **Developer-controlled** | EOA | our backend (unattended CI) |
| Keeper — roll · settle · withdraw | **Developer-controlled** | EOA | our backend (unattended CI) |
| Heartbeat taker | **Developer-controlled** | EOA | our backend (unattended CI) |
| Public Desk reader | **User-controlled** | SCA | the reader's PIN, client-side only |
| Autonomous hedger agent | **Circle agent wallet** | SCA (Circle-custodied) | the Circle CLI, under an email-OTP session |
| Contract deployer | raw key, offline, used once | EOA | a human, once |

---

## The constraints that force each choice

### C1 — `ecrecover` on-chain forces an **EOA** account type

`ACROracle.verify` and `AttestationRegistry.attestWithSig` recover the signer
with `ecrecover` (`contracts/src/ACROracle.sol:165`,
`contracts/src/AttestationRegistry.sol:86`). A smart-contract account signs via
ERC-1271, which `ecrecover` cannot check.

So the press wallet is a developer-controlled wallet created with
`account_type="EOA"` — custodied by Circle, but an EOA on-chain
(`scripts/create_circle_wallet.py:67-75`). "Custodied" and "EOA" are orthogonal:
Circle holds the key, the chain still sees an EOA.

### C2 — Unattended automation forces **developer-controlled**, not an agent wallet

A Circle agent wallet authenticates with **email + OTP and the session expires**
(`circle wallet status` reports an expiry). That is correct for an agent a human
is working with, and wrong for a cron job that must roll a series at 02:17 UTC
with nobody watching.

Developer-controlled wallets authenticate with an API key and an entity secret —
no session, no human. That is why the maker, the keeper and the heartbeat taker
are developer-controlled even though they are "bots".

### C3 — The reader's money forces **user-controlled**

On the Public Desk the key is derived and held in the reader's browser; the
server only mints `contractExecution` challenges that the reader's PIN
authorizes (`services/index_api/index_api/desk.py:1-14`). This server never
holds a reader's key, and no server-side script can stand in for the ceremony —
`make desk-e2e` drives a real browser for exactly this reason.

Gas is sponsored by Circle Gas Station. Sponsorship is only readable from the
ERC-4337 `UserOperationEvent`'s `paymaster` topic, **never** from `networkFee` —
an early draft of `scripts/desk_evidence.py` concluded "not sponsored" from the
fee alone and was wrong. Do not reintroduce the fee-based heuristic.

### C4 — x402 `exact` forces an EOA signature — but not an exported key

The x402 `exact` / `GatewayWalletBatched` scheme is EIP-3009, and the facilitator
`ecrecover`s the authorization. The repo concluded from this that "the buyer
needs a raw, exportable EOA key" (`docs/agent-runbook.md:26-30`).

**That conclusion is narrower than it reads.** It holds only when *our own code*
signs the authorization — which is what `apps/agent/src/payer.ts` does, passing a
raw `privateKey` into Circle's `GatewayClient`. When the **Circle CLI** pays
(`circle services pay`), Circle signs on the agent wallet's behalf through its
backing EOA, and nothing needs to be exported. `circle gateway balance` shows
that backing EOA explicitly.

So there are two valid buyer designs, and they answer different questions:

- **our own agent signs** → needs a raw exportable EOA (today's `apps/agent`);
- **the Circle agent wallet pays** → no key anywhere (`circle services pay`).

The second is what the autonomous hedger uses.

### C5 — The venue forces the maker and taker to be **different wallets**

`ACRFutures.trade` requires `msg.sender != s.maker`
(`contracts/src/ACRFutures.sol:242`) — the maker cannot take its own quote. The
maker and the heartbeat taker are therefore two separate developer-controlled
wallets, not one.

`openSeries` is `onlyOwner`, but it takes the maker as a **parameter**
(`ACRFutures.sol:174`), so moving the maker to a Circle wallet needed no
ownership transfer — only the next roll.

### The venue is now owned by a Circle wallet too

Done on 2026-08-03 via `scripts/migrate_venue_owner.py`, and verified on-chain
rather than from the script's own report:

```
owner        0x9D44A7Dd4e7bF173B3F13ee41E1B60C8e92388d2   (Circle custody, the maker)
pendingOwner 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

The retiring EOA `0x33189c…` now holds **no authority over the venue at all** —
not owner, not pending owner. It keeps a small balance and nothing else.

Two-step ownership is what made this safe to attempt: `transferOwnership` only
nominates, so a failed Circle leg would have left the old owner in full control
with no window in which nobody owned the contract.

It also unlocked a capability rather than just tidying a diagram. Because the
maker is now the owner, `keeper.roll_if_needed` can open a successor series by
itself — before this it could only detect that a roll was due and shout for a
human, since the process does not hold the owner's key and should not. The
venue's entire lifecycle now runs unattended under custody signing.

## What is *not* available on testnet

**Agent-wallet spending policies are mainnet-only.** Circle's
`agent-wallet-policy` skill defines per-transaction / daily / weekly / monthly
USDC caps enforced by the CLI, but testnet chains are rejected, and setting a
policy requires a human OTP in an interactive terminal.

Every spend cap in ACR is therefore **application-level**: the agent's own
`--limit`, the desk's `MAX_QTY` and faucet caps, the hedger's position cap. We
do not claim platform-enforced budgets, because on Arc testnet we cannot have
them. Whether they are coming to developer-controlled wallets is an open
question for Circle, recorded in `CIRCLE-SESSION-QUESTIONS.md`.

## Why signing through Circle costs nothing in code

`FuturesClient` never touches a key. It takes a `Signer`
(`packages/acr_oracle_client/acr_oracle_client/futures.py:296-309`) and every
write funnels through one `_send`. `CircleWalletSigner.send_transaction`
(`signer.py:164-169`) discards the locally built nonce/gas/chainId and hands the
`to` + `data` to Circle's `contract_execution`, then polls to `CONFIRMED` for the
real on-chain hash.

This path is **proven in production**: the hourly oracle prints are Circle
`CONTRACT_EXECUTION` transactions, and the desk faucet moves USDC the same way
(`desk.py:_send_stake`).

The reason the venue scripts still used raw keys is mundane: they pass an
explicit `private_key`, and `build_signer` prefers a raw key over configured
Circle credentials whenever one is present (`signer.py:250-253`). Remove the key
and the same code signs through custody.

Two things do **not** come for free, and both are handled:

1. Each script derives its own address with `Account.from_key(...)`. That is an
   EOA-only assumption; it becomes `signer.address`.
2. The USDC `approve` step bypasses the `Signer` seam entirely and hand-signs
   with `eth_account` (`scripts/futures_roll.py:134-145`). It has to route
   through the signer like everything else.

## The agent wallet has two on-chain identities, and both are it

This is the detail that resolves C4, and it is worth knowing before reading the
ledger. Measured on 2026-08-03, the same agent doing one loop:

| Rail | Identity recorded | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The x402 settlement | `0x71e140d9…` — the **backing EOA** | `exact`/EIP-3009 needs a signature `ecrecover` can verify, so Circle signs with the SCA's backing EOA |
| The on-chain `Traded` event | `0x1Dc707E3…` — the **SCA** | `trade` reads `msg.sender`, and the userOp executes as the smart account |

So `/marketplace/receipts` shows a payer that is not the address on the trade,
and both are the same agent. The transaction's `from` is a third address again —
the ERC-4337 bundler — which is normal for a smart account and not a party to
anything.

This is why an agent wallet **can** buy x402 despite the EOA-only rule: it does
not sign with the SCA at all. The runbook's conclusion was right about the
protocol and wrong about the consequence.

## An integration bug worth reporting upstream

`circle services pay` fails from a clean environment with:

```
Error: Could not sign payment authorization.
  Hint: Failed during Gateway batched payment signature creation.
  Technical details: ReferenceError: crypto is not defined
```

The message reads like a wallet or protocol problem — it is a **missing Node
global**. The fix is `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-global-webcrypto`, which
`scripts/hedger.py` sets for every CLI call. Measured on Node **v26**, where
`crypto` is a global at the top level, so something in the CLI's signing path
runs without it. `circle wallet execute` is unaffected; only the payment leg.

Worth flagging because the symptom points away from the cause: it cost a live
run that reported "payment failed" while the trade beside it succeeded, and
nothing in the error suggests a runtime flag.

## Why CI is the one place a raw key is still the *safer* choice

The obvious next step after moving the venue into custody is "put the Circle
credentials in GitHub Actions too, and delete every private key." That would
make things **worse**, and it is worth being explicit about why.

Compare what an attacker gets from a compromised runner:

| Credential in CI | What it controls |
|---|---|
| A raw EOA key | that one wallet's balance — a couple of USDC on a liveness bot |
| `ACR_CIRCLE_API_KEY` + `ACR_CIRCLE_ENTITY_SECRET` | **every** developer-controlled wallet: the treasury, the venue maker, *and* the wallet that signs oracle prints |

The entity secret is not a smaller blast radius than a private key — it is a
much larger one, and it includes the index's signing authority, which is the
integrity of the product rather than merely its money. `keepalive.yml` already
records this decision: it takes the custody *address* so it can check a balance,
never the credentials that could move it.

So the rule is **narrowest credential for the job**, not "custody everywhere":

- work that needs custody authority (posting prints, funding, opening or
  collateralising a series) runs from a **trusted host** — the deployed service,
  or an operator's machine — where the entity secret already lives;
- work that runs in **CI** gets either no credential at all (read-only checks) or
  a key scoped to a single low-value wallet it is allowed to drain.

That is why migrating the venue's *capital* to Circle wallets is the win, and
migrating CI's *liveness bot* would not be. A future improvement is to move the
heartbeat and the roll onto the trusted host entirely, at which point CI needs
no signing credential of any kind.

## Operational rules

- **One wallet, one job.** The failure this design replaces had a single raw EOA
  acting as venue maker, keeper, contract owner *and* x402 revenue address; a
  second one was both the heartbeat taker and the x402 buyer, shared across three
  workflows that can race each other's nonces.
- **The press and the faucet share a wallet today.** Documented at
  `desk.py:50-54`; the faucet floor is expressed as days of press runway so a
  drained faucet can never stop the oracle.
- **Never put the entity secret in CI.** `keepalive.yml` takes the custody
  *address* (`ACR_CUSTODY_ADDRESS`), not credentials, so a compromised runner
  cannot move custody funds.
- **Circle returns lowercase addresses.** web3 rejects a non-checksummed
  address, and the resulting error looks like RPC throttling rather than a format
  problem. Checksum at every boundary (`desk.py:609-617`).
- **Gateway settles in batches.** Each payment gets a settlement UUID; Gateway
  posts batched on-chain transactions. The honest description is "N x402
  payments + Gateway batch settlements", not "N on-chain transactions".
